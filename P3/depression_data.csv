###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,1,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2319,53,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2319,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've been depressed for the majority of my life, since I was about six years old and now I'm 20. I've been on medication for about three years and its helped me a lot, but I feel myself slipping away again. 

I graduated in June 2019, I started working at Burger King before I graduated so I would have something to do afterwards. It was shit conditions, so much stress and  not getting payed well, but it was at least a job. I managed to find another job at a call centre as tech support for one of the biggest TV companies in Sweden. This job was also shit but better than Burger King. But I didn't want to go to work, I would go to the toilet and wish for the time to go faster. Customers would call us idiots, yell at us and call us all the names in the book. On top of that we had a lot of pressure from our boss. No call should be longer than 10 minutes, during that time you hade to register the ticket while talking to the customer and we had to sell them things aswell. No matter how well we did we could always do better. Once again I have a new job which is amazing. But I feel like the stress from this and last year is taking its toll on me. I haven't been unemployed since I left school and I haven't had more than 3 days off at the same time (besides some weekends) and I'm losing my mind. 

I want to quit, I feel like I cant live anymore. Sometimes I cry between calls I take because I feel so overwhelmed. I have an amazing boyfriend but he doesn't really know how bad it is. My mom knows me but she doesn't either really know how bad I feel. I try to stay strong for them but I don't know for how much longer I can do that. I have a doctor I go too and a psychologist. I told the doctor that i often forget words, cant sleep properly, have lots of anxiety and slur on words quite often. So far we've taken like 5 blod samples but nothing really sticks out. 

I'm tired of feeling like shit, I'm trying to get help but it doesn't feel like its going anywhere. My boyfriend doesn't really understand but he does his best which I appreciate. I don't want to talk about it too much either, I don't want it to come off as complaining and annoying. 

I feel like if I quit my job for a month or two, maybe that's enough time for my body and mind to rest so I can start working again or study. Or I work now and save money so I can study much sooner. I don't know what to do, I dont want to let anyone down but I feel like I'm at my breaking point.

,depression,"so

in the bad times of my life

i have always used different coping strategies

sometimes ive combined them, sometimes ive developed new ones

let me make a list
- eating (i was obese for a long time)
- drugs (i used over 30 different substances, some of them were a habit, including benzodiapenines and opiates)
- stealing (i went stealing stuff from stores when i felt bad, sometimes little, sometimes large things. i got pretty good at it, until i got caught over a stolen nuisance, and never triedagain)
- video games (i was horribly addicted to them at one point)
- exercise (after my time of obesity, i started doing sports everyday, working out often until i almost passed out over months. when i could not exercise due to injury i felt useless and depressed)

so ive tried all of these, and now its covid, and i think i found a new, very toxic way to cope: tinder. seriously, this is so toxic, i have a hard time writing about it. the secret to not being afraid of rejection, of not having to wait for texts, is to have an entire queu of girls who are waiting to text to you. its fun, its real fun, but i noticed recently how obsessed i've become with it. if i would have to stop today, there would be nothing left, i am already feeling like shit most of the time, without tinder, without the women i text and meet, there would be nothing left.

i know that this is toxic, wrong, and i should probably be ashamed of what i am doing. but returning to drugs is not an option, it is too cold to exercise outside and i am injured, stealing is not an option aswell as i do have a record, and i will never return to gaming.

,depression,"Your kind of just empty inside, you can't laugh, cry, or feel emotions that aren't just some built up character you've made for yourself.
You feel like a narcissist all the time. Apart of you hates every imperfection outside and inside, metaphorically and literally. As a kid, you were probably singled out for behaving in a socially unacceptable manner or found yourself alone with no actual friends who aren't just acquaintances from work and happen to stick around.

You can't help but make comments and statements in your head. Arguing with yourself and some pointless argument you had earlier with some random on the internet. But you were too out of it to say it quickly or had to go back to work. You spend most of your time fantasizing and painting a perfect world thats only in your head, while criticizing everything about it, along with everyone around you. 

You become a Loner, you think you have depression and want to kill yourself. But really you want to lash out against a world you feel is wrong. Like everything in it is poison, and instead of killing you it's slowly choking you and making everything as uncomfortable as possible. So you match what your feeling on the inside and push people away. And when you're at your peak. You get more self destructive and can't stop.

Suicides not the option, when it's just being angry at yourself for not being the idealized vison of your perspective of perfection. Its best to just lash it out with yourself instead of the people around you. But you can't help it, you know you shouldn't but its the part of you that wants everything to be perfect.
Once you accept that part, its just the beginning.

Because you still feel empty and nothing fills the hole inside. Your living with every imperfection, its what normal people do. No matter how shitty or cringey it was of any number of the things that you could've done. You get to continue going for that perfection and overcome that. Thats the hard part, because the world won't be the one you picture in your head. 

That's where you fall back into the cycles of repeating mistakes which will then become choice, or you can break them. But you'll always be tempted to fall back into the routine. Even doing drugs, drinking and sleeping with strangers, won't fill that hole. Its a temporary escape, making excuses for why you didn't do any of the things you at some point wanted to do. The regret being the biggest imperfection that is being unable to accept the outside world. 

Its a cycle that won't stop, but you can minimalize your damage to others by just focusing on your own issues. Even if it means your all alone, repeating the cycle of hating yourself and temporarily escaping any way you can.

,depression,"The time of the year that i am dreading the most is getting close and i do not know what to do...

A bit of my background.

As a kid i moved between countries a lot because of my parents' work and at first i loved it however I never managed to make any real friends...

When i turned 18 i came out to my family as gay, but no one accepted me, the environment was just too hostile to live in, being threatened every day was just so exhausting and i decided to leave my home and country and try to find happiness elsewhere, while keeping very little contact with my family.

I am 26 now and in the last 7 years i moved quite a bit, for University, work, ex boyfriend etc, and last year i had to move back home in order to fulfill my national service in the army... unfortunately it still is obligatory and if i dont do it, i will have problems renewing my passport or re-entering the country. It was a horrible experience, because the army is just so homophobic and i had to hide who i am in order to keep my physical integrity...

The very next day of finishing the army, i started looking for a job outside my country, i got through many interviews and by July i actually got an amazing job offer in Barcelona/Spain. I did not hesitate at all, took it straight away and i moved to Barcelona in September. Now it's been just over 2 months that i am here, the current situation with Corona has not allowed me to make any friends at all, i have met people but i know none of them actually consider me a friend and everytime i messaged them and suggested to meet up for something, its always the same asnwer ""yeah sure, i will let you know"" and i can see on social media they go out a lot but never invite me... Even before Corona i found it hard to make friends... they just never seem interested enough to invite me for anything...

So....

All i do now is work from home and then either go for a walk or spend the rest of the day in my room watching Netflix or a little bit of gaming on my pc.

At first i loved going for walks as it helped me clear my head and exercise but now it only makes me feel worse, i go out and all i see is people in groups, friends, couples, families and i am walking between the crowds feeling like a shadow, like i don't exist.

Sometimes the emotions become so hard to hold in so i will go somewhere isolated so people don't see me crying.

Now we are less than a month away from Christmas and all i can see is my ""friends"" on Facebook and people that i have chatted to here in Barcelona making plans with friends and family and Christmas is just a reminder that i will be spending it completely alone and that i have no one. I share a flat with some other people, however 2 of them moved out last week and the last one is moving home for Christmas so i will be completely isolated for few weeks...

I wish i had someone who cares about me. Someone who wants to get to know me, a friend that i can talk to when i feel down, someone to tell me everything will be alright, someone to just give me a hug and let me feel some warmth because i don't remember the last time i felt loved or welcome anywhere.

,depression,"I have actually been planning to make a thread similar to this for a year...which - as you will see if you read on - coincides very well with the rest of my personality...

I am a 29 yo male, best described as a major fuckup by profession. I studied at an ""elite"" highschool in my country, had OK grades, but never really studied much after my mom let go of micromanaging my studies, thinking if I did so well up till now I would be fine on my own..

Well she was right...sort of. I did decently on my country's equivalent of SATs, and got accepted to a great university. At this point I had to start making my decisions even more, and college work was \*impossible\* , by this point I was such an awful procrastinator that I was doomed to fail. 

And so I did, dropped right out. I still remember my mom crying at the dinner table, telling me to just go become a factory worker if I completely neglect studies.

Then I reapplied to a ""weaker"" uni, thinking the problem could be solved with an easier curriculum, spoiler alert..it wasn't . At this point I was living doing the odd online jobs, something to scrape together enough money to rent a room, and to continue existing. 

I never left the house on my own accord between the ages 14-25. I had crippling social anxiety, I had issues with my looks, issues with my very self. I dropped out of 4 (yes, four) universities in total, and I wasn't even close to making it at any point. I don't think I did more than 10 hours of effective studying put together during all those years. 

Spent years basically wasting time, with anything, really games, videos, reddit, youtube. At first I thought it must be some kind of video game addiction, or whatever, but no It was not. Even back in high school, I literally sat in an empty room with only my books, and still managed to put together close to zero effective work. 

I went to study in the library during my university days, and I managed sit with my books, and decided instead to read up on nanotubes in a random book next to me ( literally). It was all so agitating, because all the while it was eating me up inside, even during those very moments.

I went back to live with my parents in the countryside after my streak of failures. My mom pushed me into a desk job, which was the most basic data entry position ever, with my lack of skill or knowledge in anything. I don't fault her, I am thankful because I am incapable of making such an effort on my own ( think I am pretty much the perfect homeless person candidate in a different universe ). 

I do odd things. Once my boss asked me to complete a task that would take at best 2 hours of active work. I finished that shit by 4 am, yes 4 am.  Stayed up all night because I can't spend more than 2 minutes focusing on work at once.

I tried learning to code, (what I went to uni for at first), but I've started the udemy classes I bought about 30 times by now, never got further than 10 minutes in, like ever.

Sometimes I literally take 5 minutes of walking up and down to start taking a shower. I actually started working out at home as well. Only issue is, it takes me roughly 3 horus to complete a 45 min routine, because I take massive breaks before and after every set....I just can't...Oh yea, and I do it at night before going to sleep, I just can't get myself to do it during the day.

So anyway...COVID came. My company let go of the weaker performers of some divisions. Needless to say, I was one of them.  My boss' words ""we know this could have been very different, but you never shown any willingness for it""

So yea, I was earning minimum wage. Which in my country Estonia is 520 euros a month. Or basically 8500$ a year for you americans. I had that for 3 years..and I never managed to move a finger to change it.

I hated work, i hated going to work, I hated my wage, everything about it. But I was powerless to make the tiniest change. 

I am sick...I know I am. There is no way a human is supposed to exist the way I do.

I've seen psychiatrists in the past, 2 times to be exact. I was diagnosed with depression both times, put on SSRI meds. 

The meds worked, somewhat, but not in the way I wished they did. My doc told me I will find joy in more things once again once we continue with the therapy, but it did fuckall for me.

My mood was improved by a lot, I wasn't a miserable person anymore, but I was still ME. Still unable to do anything productive, unable to control any of my urges. Still the weird person doing 3 hour workouts during the night. Out of a job for 4 months now, back at home living with my parents, living on my last savings.

And how does WoW come into all this you might ask? It's just something I have done for every expansion that ever released since my high school years. Come together with my friends and have a good time. 

I am too ashamed to tell them I am out of the shitty job I even had. They are all on actual career paths, with their degrees. 

Once it registered in me that I can't even afford to buy a 50 euro game to play with them, and that I am inevitably going to lie about it to them... it just felt like a nice roundoff to all my past failures.

Cried for a solid hour, then I made the decision to tell about it to some randoms on the internet. Maybe someone will read it, not that there is much of interest in here. And yea, that decision was 2 days ago and you are only just reading it now. 

Thank you,

In option 1, I open up to someone, tell them I want to die, and what happens?

It's not their fault, I can't expect anybody to care about me when I can't care about myself, can I? at this point I'm not very capable of loving people anymore, and so the reward to anybody who tries to help of strengthening a relationship is not available.

In option 2, I repress the bad feelings with escapist media and drugs like I usually do, but that is obviously even worse for me. In the short term, however, I am able to function somewhat normally, and I can spare people around me from the potentially immense burden of giving a shit about my emotional stability.

It's raining over you and your sad little bundle of wet fire wood. You can rub em together all you like, no fire will come of it.

Your best hope is to build some kind of shelter, to protect that fire from the rain. But now you're stuck with twice the work, half the time, four times the effort and all just for a little bit of warmth.

And if you do manage to get that fire made with something to shelter it from the rain, by the time you feel its warmth, everyone else has already used theirs to cook their meals. And you remember ""oh right, I gotta eat too.""

,depression," 

I've realised too late in my youth what the world really is. It took me a long time to figure that out. And it took a lot of guts. I havent been happy for a very long time. But i now know that its not about being happy, but about being content. You''ll never reach happiness, so why bother? But you can be content with the way things are. And i believe thats the most important thing in life tbh.

This world isnt good. Its a bad place. If we view the world as a bad place, then every miserable thing that will happen to us will make us sad. Cause we are trying to be happy in world where its impossible. So youll try and be happy, but you wont be able to. And itll destroy your life.

But i have found a way to beat this. If you see the world as a bad place, full of suffering and torment, then youll always aim to be not sad, but just ok. Then youll always expect bad things to happen to you. But when a good thing happens to you. you'll be happy in that brief moment in time, and youll appreciate that happiness more without even striving towards it. Then youll go back to being content. And thats ok. Youll remember memories better than the average person, and those little moments where you feel happy.

so basically life isnt fair. it never was. and if we try to make it fair, we will lose everytime. so dont.

live for those little moments.

But when I started feeling less intelligent, I felt like I took a bullet to the chest.

Oddly enough, I didn't pick up the puzzles hobby until I just started feeling depressed a couple years back. I didn't share my hobbies with anyone though, as I didn't want to. Because I felt so different from everyone else, that no one understood me, so it was extremely hard for me to relate to them. But that's why I have different personalities for each friend lol.

&lt;p&gt;I sit in my room kept alive by food and the molecular processes of my body. I see the world through youtube, netflix, online interaction. All contrived performances. Then if I want to go to the real thing I get so much anxiety I can’t be myself. Can’t think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was to really be myself I would constantly scream fuck you and punch everyone. Flipping them off but they wouldn’t care so I would have to hurt them physically.&lt;/p&gt;

I basically failed my A-levels and wanted to take some time off for myself, but no, I was given the ultimatum to either apply for university or find work. I got stuck into hard drugs (specifically GHB and amphetamine) 3 years ago and that really took a toll on my serotonin and dopamine, and I have been far worse off since stopping that and going to rehab last year. I was prescribed quetiapine and that’s done nothing but made me gain weight, completely numb me emotionally, made me lose ALL motivation for my hobbies, and basically made me not want to get out of bed.

This year has been really tough. Like *really* tough. I was off work most of this year and I lost my job at the end of July. So far I have had no luck in finding new employment. I had to stop looking two months ago because I just couldn’t do it. Everyone asks me if I’m doing okay and I just give the standard ‘yes’, because I don’t know what else to say.

I’ve been on and off drinking all year. Like 1-2 week binges with a 70cL bottle of vodka a day. It’s one of the only things that makes me feel okay. I have no friends whatsoever, and when I try to talk to people, they end up blanking me or flat out leaving. I’ve given up with that now. I don’t have anyone, and I don’t want to talk to people.

To top it all off, I got into contact with my GP about a medication change to sertraline to see if that can help. I’ve tried therapy/counselling and mental health courses. They do not work. I last heard from my GP and local mental health service about their considerations of changing my medication. That was on the 3rd of November. I’ve so far got into contact with my GP twice since then, and have heard absolutely nothing.

All I want is to feel okay, find another job, and be productive again. My room is a tip, my bed is covered in random things and rubbish. I can’t be bothered. I don’t care anymore.

I guess I’m just having a bad day today. I don’t want pity. I don’t want attention. I don’t want people to tell me that everything is going to be alright. I just want to let you all know that life is fucking shit and I honestly don’t see the point in going on. No, I’m not suicidal. No, I haven’t self harmed recently.

Have you ever been lonely?
Even if you are not
Even if you have supportive friends 
You can feel so alone

So harmful

The thing that is pain 
The thing that stops pain

It makes you ponder

That your death would ruin

That your death would ruin

Would blame themselves 
Who would hold themselves accountable

,depression,"I'm almost 25 and it has become clear to me that I want to end my life.

When I was around 15, it became clear I wanted a university degree. I was an underachiever in school and my mother kept pushing me to drop out of school. She would scream and insult me when I resist. But I kept fighting back to stay in school, often involving counsellors to defend me because I felt I wouldn't be listened to if I spoke myself.

I didn't meet the requirements for university. My mother pushed me into a graphic design course I did for 6 months, then I pushed back into a university preparation course, then she pushed me into an arts degree after I completed the university preparation course, I did that for a year even though I didn't want to, then pushed back and started a Computer Science degree.

As you can see, there was no clear plan. Just two different conflicting ideals. But sadly for her, it is my life so she can fuck off and stop controlling it.

I did a year of a Computer Science degree. I consider going to university and doing a degree of my own choice the proudest thing I've ever been proud of -- because my mother made it her mission to make sure it doesn't happen. Yelling at me to give up and forget it.

The process of staying in school and going to university was a hurtful and intense experience which redefined what I want out of life, and my parent's roles in my life. It didn't happen once; it happened every year from 15 onwards until I no longer needed to rely on them. My sister believes my mother did nothing wrong and believes I'm just blaming her -- I believe she's just too blindly loyal to see any wrongdoing in my mother's behaviour.

After a year of my degree, I fell into deep depression and left university for 2 years. One year I was on the welfare, the next year I worked at a supermarket (grocery store). They didn't appreciate me there. I was honest about my struggles with mental health early on, and had issues with talking to myself in the isle. It was a tough experience.

After that, I quit and came back to university.

I have an ongoing backward-thinking habit. I don't know where it comes from, but it has existed for my whole adult life. I continually think about people, places, and memories from my past, and feel a frequent urge to search them up online to see how they are now. I feel regret at hurting others and smile at the nicer memories. I still think about YouTube personalities I used to watch at about 10 years ago who haven't uploaded videos for years.

I've seeked out EMDR because I believed it was trauma. But now I'm not sure. I don't know why I continually live in the past, but I believe it is a lifelong habit I'm stuck with.

Now I'm almost 25 in a week. I've seen many of my peers in the 4 different courses at 3 different institutions I've done graduate, I'm watching peers from high school and university have babies and get married. Every day I'm just reminded of how far away my high school years ago, and watch as peers keep moving ahead with their lives.

Even if I do graduate and get a degree, so what? I'm still going to keep looking backwards forever.

I've decided I don't want children because the inability to move on from past experiences isn't practical.

I've also had a lot of fun in my youth and it seems from here, it gets a whole lot more boring.

So I don't really see much point in being alive anymore.

,depression,"
I have had a couple of rounds of therapy (college counselling) in the past due to I’d say relatively mild depression and anxiety, and I remembered a little moment with one of my therapists that really hit me hard. I can’t remember exactly what we were talking about, something really depressing about myself, like how I feel unloveable or something like that, and she laughed to herself and then had this really guilty look on her face. She then apologised to me, and I asked what for.

She said that she’d laughed at what I said involuntarily because I have this habit of smiling and kind of laughing off whatever I’m saying whenever I’m talking about my feelings, and that she always kind of struggles not to laugh along with me and has to remind herself that I’m talking about some serious stuff, no matter how much she wants to laugh at a joke or smile back at me. She said I’ve got an infectious kind of smile though that she supposed people would just want to smile along with and not call out, as she even felt herself doing it too and she was a professional. She asked me if I noticed that I done this, but I honestly never had, at least not consciously. I have always used humour as a defence mechanism, but it’s weird to think that any time I open up to someone I actually will smile and laugh while I’m telling them how low I feel, how I feel pathetic, etc. 

I dunno, it was just weird having someone notice something like that. I’ve always felt people don’t take me seriously, and I assume that’s probably a large part of it. The fact that even when I’m being completely serious and probably feel on the verge of tears, I still have this inclination towards smiling, appearing friendly, joking around and putting people at ease. It’s like I literally don’t want people to be let in on the fact I’m a real person with actual emotions, even though I feel like a wreck, and just want to seem detached and joke about it all constantly, keeping people at arms length rather than opening up to them in any serious way.

,depression,"I'm 26, Male and i have a story to tell.
I'm writing this on 11-30-20. My birthday
Yay happy b-day to me....
Life honestly doesn't feel the same anymore and im getting closer to that numb feeling I've heard alot about. I've been a trooper my whole life. I always kept my chin up with a smile. Maybe people just wanted to see me break down?

Heres a back story about myself before i jump into why you clicked on this.

Lifes been pretty shitty. I've had my up's and great times but most of my life has been nothing but hard times. 
My grandfather owned a business and my dad worked for him. 
So you could say i lived the middle class life growing up. 
We weren't rich but my parents always treated us to stuff when we deserved it.
My problems aren't financial related.

I didn't have many friends.  
Throughout my life i maybe had 10 friends? 
It doesn't matter now because as it stands right now i only have 2 friends. 
I was bullied from the 2nd grade -7th grade. 
I was just a target to alot of kids. 
One day in the 5th grade my older brother passed away from a heart condition that runs in the family. 
Its called prolonged qt syndrome just incase you were curious.

My teacher obviously found out and she had the whole class write me ""feel better"" cards they made from the classes art supplies but my bully was also in that class. 
I'll never forget what that bully said to me the day after my brothers funeral.
He laughed at me and said ""Your brothers dead"".
I mentally snapped and blacked out.
I only remember being pulled off him by the teacher.
I was punished for it ultimately while he got away scott free because his friends lied for him.

One day in the 7th grade, i finally had enough and snapped on one of the guys who wouldn't leave me alone.
 He was walking behind me and slapped me in the back of the head for no reason at all. 
At that very moment, i already had the thought of ""I've had enough of people's shit"" running through my mind.
 Not in the school shooter type of way, but in a way i would finally stand up for myself against people who made me a target. 
So when he hit me i just let loose. 

I ended up breaking his ankle. 
He was heavy set guy. 
I'd say he was 5'4 and 320 pound easy.
i stepped on his foot with all my weight and pushed him sideways. 
Well, that landed me in hot water obviously.
 I got in way more trouble than him even though i was fighting back against a bully who did nothing but mentally and physically abuse me. 
He got to stay in school and they put me in a Behavioral Disorder school or ""BD school"" as most call it.  
I ended up dropping out my sophomore year because i was just done with life and everyones shit.

The fact that i was in trouble for doing the right thing for myself created one hell of a ride for me in the future and I'm at equal fault for the results these experiences yielded. 
I could have handled things better in life.

(So now that you have some what of a bio of myself, let me get to major points)

Around late 2011, early 2012 i ended up in my first relationship surprisingly.
 She treated me with respect, love and everything else a healthy relationship brings to the table. 
I found this to be odd at first because of how negative people have been to me.
 I grew used to this and thats where i fucked up. 
I let my guard down completely and told her why i felt misunderstood my whole life. 

I felt misunderstood because no matter what i did to defend myself or to please others i always got looked at like i did something wrong. 
Not just by my peers, but also people my age.
I felt like a total outcast my whole life.
The relationship only lasted a little under 2 years. Towards the end of that relationship i was going through another rough patch.

I found out she was cheating on me. 
I was angry, upset and didn't know why she would do that to me. 
I initially exploded verbally towards her. I could have handled myself better thinking about it now but what she did next is just cold.

I begged for her back, pleaded and poured my heart out to her over the phone. 
She laughed and handed the phone to her new toy.
(I only say new toy because she was with him for like 2 weeks lol)
The guy she was cheating with was sending me voice clips on messenger. 
I knew him, he was a Friend of a friend and i was at his house a couple times. 
Most of them consisted of him gloating about how he stole my girlfriend. 

I got to a boiling point, snapped again and went to his house without warning.
Instead of banging on the door, i kicked it repeatedly.
After the first few kicks he opens the door and i shove him back inside so i can close the door behind me. 
This way nobody could see what i was about to do to this guy.

 I beat the ever living shit out of him.
He never called the police on me either surprisingly. 
My ex made me out to be this psychopath after that but 
She was just mad that i beat up her new boyfriend.
He really did ask for it in my opinion.
the rumors she spread were pretty serious because they effect me till this day. 
She claimed without a single mark on her body to prove it, that i had beat her after i beat up the boyfriend.

I still had most of my friends. 
Me and my ex were in the same small circle so it made it a bit more tough for all of us to hang out as a group after that. They knew i only beat the shit out of him.


We skip forward to 2018 and it brings us to a similar story about another ex. The relationship starts out great, she cheats and ofcourse i wanted her back.
( im hopeless i know)
We got back together and this was just a bad idea because it just became toxic after that.
 I was no longer happy but she didn't want me to leave her.  

She went full blown psychotic and started hitting, scratching and bitting herself. I was genuinely freaked the hell out and physically picked her up and put her outside.  
Her sister came and got her and when she did i quickly put her stuff outside my front door so she couldn't get back in. 
Can you guys guess whats coming next?
She claimed i beat her and her sister not only believed her but spread it around town.

This was hit of epic proportions to my reputation because not only was my last ex part of our circle, this one was too and they both now claimed that i beat them and both of these rumors spread like wildfire after the 2nd one. 
We skip to 2020 and all of my friends are gone except for 2. 
All of them just blocked me at random times and never said a word.
Like 10+ years meant nothing.

My grandpa died from a medical procedure this year too. 
We hung out everyday. 
I would get off work about 3pm and go to his store and on my days off i would go spend time with him.
We would always talk about stuff that was on our mind.
He knew what i was going through and he was there with me every step of the way.
Now that my grandpa is gone i can feel the need to go with him becoming stronger.
It feels like life just takes what little i have left and makes it dissappear and for what? I didn't do much wrong in my life
But thats just how the cookie crumbles.

The moral of the story is don't say false things about people. It can hurt them in more ways than you realize.

I can't save myself anymore and i know how this going to end for me but maybe it will get the message out there to help stop this from happening to others....

 I got in way more trouble than him even though i was fighting back against a bully who did nothing but mentally and physically abuse me. 
He got to stay in school and they put me in a Behavioral Disorder school or &amp;quot;BD school&amp;quot; as most call it.&lt;br/&gt;
I ended up dropping out my sophomore year because i was just done with life and everyones shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that i was in trouble for doing the right thing for myself created one hell of a ride for me in the future and I&amp;#39;m at equal fault for the results these experiences yielded. 
I could have handled things better in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(So now that you have some what of a bio of myself, let me get to major points)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around late 2011, early 2012 i ended up in my first relationship surprisingly.
 She treated me with respect, love and everything else a healthy relationship brings to the table. 
I found this to be odd at first because of how negative people have been to me.
 I grew used to this and thats where i fucked up. 
I let my guard down completely and told her why i felt misunderstood my whole life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt misunderstood because no matter what i did to defend myself or to please others i always got looked at like i did something wrong. 
Not just by my peers, but also people my age.
I felt like a total outcast my whole life.
The relationship only lasted a little under 2 years. Towards the end of that relationship i was going through another rough patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out she was cheating on me. 
I was angry, upset and didn&amp;#39;t know why she would do that to me. 
I initially exploded verbally towards her. I could have handled myself better thinking about it now but what she did next is just cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begged for her back, pleaded and poured my heart out to her over the phone. 
She laughed and handed the phone to her new toy.
(I only say new toy because she was with him for like 2 weeks lol)
The guy she was cheating with was sending me voice clips on messenger. 
I knew him, he was a Friend of a friend and i was at his house a couple times. 
Most of them consisted of him gloating about how he stole my girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to a boiling point, snapped again and went to his house without warning.
Instead of banging on the door, i kicked it repeatedly.
After the first few kicks he opens the door and i shove him back inside so i can close the door behind me. 
This way nobody could see what i was about to do to this guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I beat the ever living shit out of him.
He never called the police on me either surprisingly. 
My ex made me out to be this psychopath after that but 
She was just mad that i beat up her new boyfriend.
He really did ask for it in my opinion.
the rumors she spread were pretty serious because they effect me till this day. 
She claimed without a single mark on her body to prove it, that i had beat her after i beat up the boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had most of my friends. 
Me and my ex were in the same small circle so it made it a bit more tough for all of us to hang out as a group after that. They knew i only beat the shit out of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We skip forward to 2018 and it brings us to a similar story about another ex. The relationship starts out great, she cheats and ofcourse i wanted her back.
( im hopeless i know)
We got back together and this was just a bad idea because it just became toxic after that.
 I was no longer happy but she didn&amp;#39;t want me to leave her.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She went full blown psychotic and started hitting, scratching and bitting herself. I was genuinely freaked the hell out and physically picked her up and put her outside.&lt;br/&gt;
Her sister came and got her and when she did i quickly put her stuff outside my front door so she couldn&amp;#39;t get back in. 
Can you guys guess whats coming next?
She claimed i beat her and her sister not only believed her but spread it around town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was hit of epic proportions to my reputation because not only was my last ex part of our circle, this one was too and they both now claimed that i beat them and both of these rumors spread like wildfire after the 2nd one. 
We skip to 2020 and all of my friends are gone except for 2. 
All of them just blocked me at random times and never said a word.
Like 10+ years meant nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandpa died from a medical procedure this year too. 
We hung out everyday. 
I would get off work about 3pm and go to his store and on my days off i would go spend time with him.
We would always talk about stuff that was on our mind.
He knew what i was going through and he was there with me every step of the way.
Now that my grandpa is gone i can feel the need to go with him becoming stronger.
It feels like life just takes what little i have left and makes it dissappear and for what? I didn&amp;#39;t do much wrong in my life
But thats just how the cookie crumbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is don&amp;#39;t say false things about people. It can hurt them in more ways than you realize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t save myself anymore and i know how this going to end for me but maybe it will get the message out there to help stop this from happening to others....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my mental break down..&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm about to be 20.

Tonight I sit in my mom's basement tonight eating ice cream and watching youtube clips while not writing my final essay that is already late.

I have relapsed on my addiction as well as all my positive habits I have been trying to build for the last month and a half.

Since I was ten I've been in and out of therapist offices, 5 of them in total. The first two were forced and the last three I sought on my own.

My friends are all stem nerds I still know from high school, one has a job at tesla already while in school, one is about to get an internship at Lockheed, the other works in IT.

I am a virgin community college student who failed last semester and is pursuing a history degree that won't even get me a job.

I'm just tired. No matter how hard I try nothing fundamentally changes. I have been attempting different regimens and good habits for literally years. I always start out attempting to eat right, sleep before 6am, go for walks, stop procrastinating, stop watching porn, etc. This inevitably fails every single time as it did after this month.

maybe it's just the illness talking, but I am starting to think it really doesn't get better. Is life worth living if it's just an endless struggle to feel normal or good about myself?

Now, I understand that it is still, of course, my fault if I don't keep my feelings in check, but I keep getting these awful, very hard to control mood swings. I don't quite know what to do with myself when I get hurt for little or no reason at all and get all sad and prickly and, at times, passive aggressive.

After one of those sudden little outbursts one of my friends basically made a point to tell me that I'm an emotional mine and I'm very hard to talk to, often, because of that. He said that he doesn't want to talk to me, at all, at times such as this and after these incidents.

The thing is, I struggle a lot right now, and having just all of my very few friends on top of that get sick of me just makes it worse, even though I totally respect their need to distance themselves from me or cut me out of their life completely. That whole conversation made me feel extremely guilty and I apologized as best as I could, though I still fucked up even in that, I think.

I also realized that I'm having suicidal thoughts again, after a long time of not having that problem.

I don't know what I'm seeking typing this now, but I just... don't know what to do and who to talk to. A therapist might be a good option, I suppose, but at this moment I don't feel like I have the strength to ask for an appointment. Everything stings and I can't bear the thought of telling about it all out loud. It feels like my whole life is crumbling around me and I don't have anyone or anything to hold on to. I am worthless and I don't think there's any point in continuing to exist as this pile of trash that nobody rightly wants to deal with. I don't want to hurt everyone around me anymore.

I hate who I am. I hate what I am becoming. I hate that I cannot change and I hate that my heart is not as warm as I wish it to be and my soul as light as I thought it once was.

I want to hurt myself. I want to see what once was inside stream out in meandering waves of red disdain. 

I want to be loved, and I have wished for it so for long, without realising that I cannot be loved - the person that I am is not deserving of it. I finally have come to understand that after years of lying to myself through facades and daydreams.

I am no better than the people that I judge. 

It has reached the point where I feel as though I belong in this sense of self, in this sense of life and this particular journey. As much as I have tried to climb the ragged walls that cave me in this path, I seem to slip and fall at every manoeuvre. I have come to accept this now.

What keeps me here is guilt. I envision my five year old self staring up at me with her brown eyes, such innocence and unknowing of the choices she will one day make. Of the people that she will lose, the daydreams that she will realise are simply dreams and how the world is not as kind as she hoped it would be to her.

Even now I lie. 
I am not kind. I am not loving. I am not good. 

I am manipulative. I am selfish. I am envious. I am greedy, senseless, cold and a bitch. I am a hypocrite.

incoming relevant but also skippable story:
{{ i started life out shy, sensitive and introverted
when puberty hit i became very insecure because i was ugly and chubby.
nobody at school spoke to me because i had awful social anxiety.
i get into highschool and my anxiety isnt as crippling but i still have no friends in any of my classes and i cry during every presentation so i skip them all and get poor grades.
during highschool i meet a guy online who i start dating long distance, hes grooming me the whole time to send nudes though i didnt want to and when we fight he insults my body and pushing redpill idealogy down my throat. threatens me by repeatedly sending me my address to remind me he could come here. I eventually get the balls to leave.
i get out of highschool and start going to work for the first time, work pushes me to finally get over the worst of my social anxiety and i meet a few people who make me genuinely happy.
i get a crush on a guy at work but he’s emotionally unavailable so i download tinder bc im ready to date. Id never had sex or a boyfriend in person.
At 21 i meet my most recent ex. I am tired of telling this story but its the most harrowing thing ive been through. i thought we had something very beautiful and i was wrong. he left me feeling worse about myself than i have in a long long time.}}

What does the universe want me to do? I work on myself.. but I cant heal if every time i take 2 baby steps im kicked back so far. Is the cycle going to repeat?

&lt;p&gt;incoming relevant but also skippable story:
{{ i started life out shy, sensitive and introverted
when puberty hit i became very insecure because i was ugly and chubby.
nobody at school spoke to me because i had awful social anxiety.
i get into highschool and my anxiety isnt as crippling but i still have no friends in any of my classes and i cry during every presentation so i skip them all and get poor grades.
during highschool i meet a guy online who i start dating long distance, hes grooming me the whole time to send nudes though i didnt want to and when we fight he insults my body and pushing redpill idealogy down my throat. threatens me by repeatedly sending me my address to remind me he could come here. I eventually get the balls to leave.
i get out of highschool and start going to work for the first time, work pushes me to finally get over the worst of my social anxiety and i meet a few people who make me genuinely happy.
i get a crush on a guy at work but he’s emotionally unavailable so i download tinder bc im ready to date. Id never had sex or a boyfriend in person.
At 21 i meet my most recent ex. I am tired of telling this story but its the most harrowing thing ive been through. i thought we had something very beautiful and i was wrong. he left me feeling worse about myself than i have in a long long time.}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the universe want me to do? I work on myself.. but I cant heal if every time i take 2 baby steps im kicked back so far. Is the cycle going to repeat? I struggle to love myself so much that i keep meeting people that abuse me and they keep pushing my progress back so that Im doomed to be hurt again? Am I really fated to never be loved because I cant love myself? Every day that I fail to love myself feels fatal, it feels like a step back on this long road towards a lovinf human relationship. Do i really not deserve one of those because of my brains response to what Ive been through?&lt;/p&gt;

Originally I wrote this long page about how I got to where I am, but no one cares. Here's the most basic, short summary I can give you: I've been depressed since \~12 because I don't feel like I belong in my own body or my own brain. Because I was depressed, I did morally atrocious things online when I was \~14. Years later now that I turned 18, I try to finally get my life back on track. Months after I try that, police raid my house due to what I did when I was 14. I try to kill myself because of the shame but end up in a hospital for two weeks, and in-patient psychiatric care for a week after that. I go home and continue therapy completely online, this time on medication. 

My life has never been this low. Six years of being depressed and hating every aspect of myself and only now am I at my lowest point.

And if my happiness isn't genuine, it doesn't matter at all.

All I can do is observe the emotions I know I should feel. I can feel happy, but it&amp;#39;s not even real. None of what I&amp;#39;m feeling is real. I&amp;#39;m drugged, literally. My emotions aren&amp;#39;t genuine. My happiness isn&amp;#39;t genuine. And if my happiness isn&amp;#39;t genuine, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter at all. None of what I&amp;#39;m feeling matters, because I know if I were off of these pills for a second that I&amp;#39;d be right back to how I was feeling months ago. Nothings changed. Nothing has gotten better. I&amp;#39;ve just been deceived with medication.&lt;/p&gt;

What seems to be the smallest stressor (which when considered pragmatically should not even be a stressor) seems to trigger my mood from a what is a constant ""meh"" to the “down” state and often lasts for days at a time. Severity comes in waves throughout the day.

I don’t feel like there is a reason to feel this way. I have a really good job and a stable home life with 2 great (albeit challenging/full on) kids and a great wife. Health is otherwise OK.

Communication with my wife could be better, as I haven’t been able to talk to her about how I feel emotionally. I really struggle to open up to ANYONE. We otherwise treat each other with love and respect. She knows I’m struggling to point, but I don’t think she understand just how badly.

While the “pressure” of my job seems to trigger my “down” state more than anything, in reality it is a very easy-going job, with completely reasonable expectations and more than enough time to complete the work I’m given. Which leads to one of my biggest problems – focus. I really struggle to stay interested and focused on a specific task or project, unless I find it particularly interesting or technically challenging. This has led me to having issues getting through my work load, triggering my “down” state frequently. “Focus” has been a problem for a few years, but especially worse since COVID has me working from home most days.

It’s not just work. Other things seem to trigger me and get me really down. Earlier this year we did some renovations and the small little elements of stress surrounding that caused the same problems. As do some social situation or times where I’m worried about being judged.

The thought of even talking to a doctor about any of this has me jittery.

Some days I feel a bit better than “OK” and convince myself everything is fine and to just keep pushing through it alone. Then it all cycles through again.

I can’t remember a time in the last few years feeling really happy or joyed about anything, apart from a handful of moments lasting a no more than few minutes, usually seeing one of my kids especially happy or hitting a milestone. Things/hobbies that once interest me don’t really excite me anymore. Although that could just be the reality of not having time for those things with a young family.

,depression,"Here it is. The day I've been dreading. I never thought after fighting for 8 years that I would be voluntarily 5150ing myself in order to seek help. 

Truth is. Im in a very dark place, and its hard to talk to my family and friends about it because It's hard to explain something about me to someone when I don't fully understand it myself. On top of the confusion I have with my emotions I have a problem with articulating sentences verbally and I think its caused as I'm an introvert. I sometimes think I have a communication disorder because I can write perfectly fine as I'm sure you've noticed already, Sometimes now becoming more often i have noticed an improvement with my speech, the communication disorder only comes out when im nervous, talking to strangers or people im not fully comfortable around, and when I speak about a topic im not really familiar with.

Back on track. 
I'm not looking forward to it because I'm going in an environment where I'm locked down in an unfamiliar place for possibly 3 days. If that won't flare ones anxiety and depression then I don't know what will.
On the other hand, I am looking forward to it to seek the proper help I need to better my life. 

I'm depressed most of the time, especially at nights.
I would fall into a deep pit of loneliness and pure sadness. If I'm gonna be honest,  I don't know what went wrong and I've been trying hard to figure it out for 3 years now. I often have passive aggressive suicidal thoughts, I don't actually want to kill myself but the thoughts stick around. I wouldn't hurt myself in anyway as I don't actually want to die. I just want to find the old me again. The old happy go lucky kid with a will to do anything again..

But thinking about something such as these suicidal thoughts is mentally draining, It takes hours for me to get out of bed some days. The thing that hurts the most is thinking of the aftermath. My final moments, the pain I will cause to my loved ones, I would end up leaving them with questions they'll never know the answer to, and guilt they'll have to live with for the rest of their lives..

I'm falling apart, I don't recognize myself anymore and nobody recognizes me from the person I once was just a few years ago.. I've lost all motivation to do anything, my life is at a standstill due to me not being productive. I should have graduated this year but I have somewhere around 90 credits left because I've just given up on absolutely everything. I have a car sitting in my moms driveway waiting for me to get a license but I just don't want to do anything about it. I think I might be going through a burnout with life. 

I've lost the joy in everything, I've been subconsciously pushing my friends away to where inhardly talk to them, basically alienating myself from everyone. Everybody has tried helping me, my mom, dad, my dads gf and her family, and many others but I just don't accept it. I push them away too and basically said screw you to everyone without meaning too because I would get angry at them because of stress and depression..they slowly stopped helping less and less because they have been bending over backwards for me only for me not to accept it because I don't know how..

I dont know where to begin. im overwhelmed with confusion, self hatred, and loneliness..I've given up the fight to try and better myself and now let my demons do whatever they want to me and I'll just take it. My mom and dad told me they hadn't given up on me and I believe it, its just that they don't know how to help me anymore because my depression has progression gotten worse throughout the years. 
I have a dying hobby that I once had a lot of fun with.
Most of my model planes are dust collectors. Spending more time in a garage then flying in the air, I walk past some of them all the time and it makes me sad seeing them rotting away because I've lost joy in it as I have no money to fuel it.

I don't believe that the opposite of depression is happiness, instead I think its vitality and vitality is something that i have lost. Everything seems like its too much work to do now.. making food, taking a shower (yes I still shower), getting up in the morning to go do something productive even when I know that it will benefit me, and many other things that I can't think of off the top of my head. Medication helps with the loss of Vitality. I see more good days where I am a little more productive but I never have truly gotten my motivation back, I am not always on my meds though which is something I am going to be working on as I have a really bad memory. I need to start setting alarms.

I think it might be important to note that a few years ago when I was 14. I was taken advantage of by one of my family members by marriage it happened twice and I eventually cut ties with him and waited quite some time to tell someone. During that time I was burying it in the back of my mind and I've kept burying and burying to where I hardly remember what exactly happened. My biggest regret is waiting  to tell someone because when the authorities were finally involved I couldn't provide any evidence but managed to remember just enough of what happened to keep my story the same. By then during that time the family member sold his truck so it couldn't be traced to him and I was dumb enough to delete the messages because I was didn't want it in my life. He got away. 

Everyone who knows agrees that it might be a root of my problems as I have not dealt with it yet as I've only buried it.

I am hoping to go to this place to receive professional help that will hopefully better me but I'm anxious about it.

The day I&amp;#39;ve been dreading. I never thought after fighting for 8 years that I would be voluntarily 5150ing myself in order to seek help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is. Im in a very dark place, and its hard to talk to my family and friends about it because It&amp;#39;s hard to explain something about me to someone when I don&amp;#39;t fully understand it myself. On top of the confusion I have with my emotions I have a problem with articulating sentences verbally and I think its caused as I&amp;#39;m an introvert. I sometimes think I have a communication disorder because I can write perfectly fine as I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve noticed already, Sometimes now becoming more often i have noticed an improvement with my speech, the communication disorder only comes out when im nervous, talking to strangers or people im not fully comfortable around, and when I speak about a topic im not really familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on track. 
I&amp;#39;m not looking forward to it because I&amp;#39;m going in an environment where I&amp;#39;m locked down in an unfamiliar place for possibly 3 days. If that won&amp;#39;t flare ones anxiety and depression then I don&amp;#39;t know what will.
On the other hand, I am looking forward to it to seek the proper help I need to better my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m depressed most of the time, especially at nights.
I would fall into a deep pit of loneliness and pure sadness. If I&amp;#39;m gonna be honest,  I don&amp;#39;t know what went wrong and I&amp;#39;ve been trying hard to figure it out for 3 years now. I often have passive aggressive suicidal thoughts, I don&amp;#39;t actually want to kill myself but the thoughts stick around. I wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt myself in anyway as I don&amp;#39;t actually want to die. I just want to find the old me again. The old happy go lucky kid with a will to do anything again..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thinking about something such as these suicidal thoughts is mentally draining, It takes hours for me to get out of bed some days. The thing that hurts the most is thinking of the aftermath. My final moments, the pain I will cause to my loved ones, I would end up leaving them with questions they&amp;#39;ll never know the answer to, and guilt they&amp;#39;ll have to live with for the rest of their lives..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m falling apart, I don&amp;#39;t recognize myself anymore and nobody recognizes me from the person I once was just a few years ago.. I&amp;#39;ve lost all motivation to do anything, my life is at a standstill due to me not being productive. I should have graduated this year but I have somewhere around 90 credits left because I&amp;#39;ve just given up on absolutely everything. I have a car sitting in my moms driveway waiting for me to get a license but I just don&amp;#39;t want to do anything about it. I think I might be going through a burnout with life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost the joy in everything, I&amp;#39;ve been subconsciously pushing my friends away to where inhardly talk to them, basically alienating myself from everyone. Everybody has tried helping me, my mom, dad, my dads gf and her family, and many others but I just don&amp;#39;t accept it. I push them away too and basically said screw you to everyone without meaning too because I would get angry at them because of stress and depression..they slowly stopped helping less and less because they have been bending over backwards for me only for me not to accept it because I don&amp;#39;t know how..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont know where to begin. im overwhelmed with confusion, self hatred, and loneliness..I&amp;#39;ve given up the fight to try and better myself and now let my demons do whatever they want to me and I&amp;#39;ll just take it. My mom and dad told me they hadn&amp;#39;t given up on me and I believe it, its just that they don&amp;#39;t know how to help me anymore because my depression has progression gotten worse throughout the years. 
I have a dying hobby that I once had a lot of fun with.
Most of my model planes are dust collectors. Spending more time in a garage then flying in the air, I walk past some of them all the time and it makes me sad seeing them rotting away because I&amp;#39;ve lost joy in it as I have no money to fuel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe that the opposite of depression is happiness, instead I think its vitality and vitality is something that i have lost. Everything seems like its too much work to do now.. making food, taking a shower (yes I still shower), getting up in the morning to go do something productive even when I know that it will benefit me, and many other things that I can&amp;#39;t think of off the top of my head. Medication helps with the loss of Vitality. I see more good days where I am a little more productive but I never have truly gotten my motivation back, I am not always on my meds though which is something I am going to be working on as I have a really bad memory. I need to start setting alarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it might be important to note that a few years ago when I was 14. I was taken advantage of by one of my family members by marriage it happened twice and I eventually cut ties with him and waited quite some time to tell someone. During that time I was burying it in the back of my mind and I&amp;#39;ve kept burying and burying to where I hardly remember what exactly happened. My biggest regret is waiting  to tell someone because when the authorities were finally involved I couldn&amp;#39;t provide any evidence but managed to remember just enough of what happened to keep my story the same. By then during that time the family member sold his truck so it couldn&amp;#39;t be traced to him and I was dumb enough to delete the messages because I was didn&amp;#39;t want it in my life. He got away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who knows agrees that it might be a root of my problems as I have not dealt with it yet as I&amp;#39;ve only buried it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to go to this place to receive professional help that will hopefully better me but I&amp;#39;m anxious about it. Guess I better start packing comfy clothes and writing down phone numbers on a piece of paper.  I think this is the first post to where I included everything I am going through. Now I just need to dig deeper and fix it.  Thanks for the read.&lt;/p&gt;

I have severe clinical depression and anxiety - I’ve been on different combos of medication since I was 14, nothing working. 

I’m 37, I have no friends, no family, and no caring in my life. I’ve not had any physical contact with another person in 15 years.

People seem to like me, but don’t invite me to spend time together, or accept my invitations.

The solitude is crippling. I listen to comedy podcasts almost on a loop, and the happiness is a distraction from the silence and a window into a happy world. But that window is often a terrible reminder of what I don’t have.

I love dogs, and thought they’d give me comfort, but I couldn’t cope with the anxiety of owning them, and weirdly I found the constant companionship disturbing. I found myself wanting to be alone.

,depression,"I am quarantined in Los Angeles, and the experience has been miserable to say the least. At first it was kind of fun, I was going on long distance runs, getting creative, and having the longest break from working I've ever had in my life. I am naturally a very motivated person, always working out, always on the go. My year had started off great. Everything I spent years working my ass off for was finally coming to fruition. Career-wise, fitness wise, life wise in general, I finally felt like opportunities were just pouring in. 

At first it was nice to slow down. Plus we had enough unemployment money at the time to actually pay our bills. Then a lot of my friends moved out of town unfortunately, so I didn't have anyone to go on socially distant runs or walks with. I spent a lot of the summer protesting (safely, with masks, please don't shame), and getting tear gassed and shot for nothing by police. I think the overstimulation and watching horrific things constantly on socials or experiencing them in real time for months on end really traumatized me. Also watching some fellow protestors lose their minds a bit- lose themselves (understandably), and having to process awful news daily. I think the last protest I went to was in September and it was so brutal I can't. 

Unfortunately instagram and other socials were the only real way to share information to keep each other safe. I never posted anything insane but I know people started to look to me for protest coverage and insight. It was hard to see a lot of people watch my stories, know I got tear gassed and not even ask a simple ""Are you okay?"" Or watch people just stay silent in general about everything that was happening. I eventually deleted my instagram and my OCD and depression constantly have me wondering if people thought I lost my mind for speaking out so loudly. The thing is I've always been this person, I've always protested, I've always worked within the community, I just never used socials in this way. I never really used socials much at all. But to some extent- I don't think people understand what a dystopian nightmare LA has become.  

Anyways, this is a bit of a ramble. I am at this point where I am so so depressed. Because of my OCD I wonder if people legitimately think my posts or stories were insane. Which is silly, because I will never regret standing up for what's right. And I also know that having OCD makes me consistently edit and overthink almost everything I put on social media before I do it, but as anyone with OCD knows- logic tends to take the passenger seat to the obsession, because I know I would defend everything I put out there if confronted. 

But moreover, I feel like at this point I have no purpose. I spend so much of my week getting up, working out, maybe going on a walk or a run. Then there will be these days when I can barely move, or I drink a whole bottle of wine and smoke cigarettes. Going from moving so much and always being on the go pre-quarantine-, to not- and drinking more than I normally would- I've gained 15 pounds. I feel horrible about everything. I feel hopeless about the future. I don't have a close family. I didn't get my unemployment last week (which is barely anything anyways). I'm afraid of my car getting repoed and the unbelievable amount of debt I'm going to be in when this is over. I had to stop going to therapy because I couldn't afford it. It just feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. 

I'm new to reddit and I told my brother about getting on it. He suggested this might be a good place to find friends or find a community. I just honestly feel really really alone. Most of my guy friends who are still out here seem to have ulterior motives (i.e. want to get in my pants). My best girl friend moved away and I'm realizing that a lot of the people I considered friends in the first place were really just social acquaintances. Today all I've done is gotten a coffee, showered, and laid on the couch feeling like crying- mostly knowing I can do it because my roommate is out of town. The sun in shining and I know I should get out and go for a run- but I am just so sad. The hardest thing about all of this is I am always the most motivated. I always make things work, I'm always glass half full. But I feel like it's so hard anymore and I can't understand how to get back to that. I reach out to friends often to go on walks or runs on nature trails and it's like pulling teeth to get a response. I wish I had someone, anyone who would do the same for me. 

I have been looking for jobs out of the country, but it's hard to even find the motivation to punch up my resume. I know this whole thing was very rambly, but my mind feels like a mess today. I feel like I just need to know there's others who are feeling this way. Maybe there are people in LA who want to go on a hike or work on something creative together?  I just feel so terribly alone.

,depression,"TW: self harm 


My partner has been in a behavioral hospital for the past four days. They are struggling with OCD that has gotten a lot worse since the pandemic. They aren’t suicidal and they don’t self harm, but there OCD has never been this bad. They can’t eat or sleep they are so anxious. We haven’t actually seen each other in person in a month because they are so afraid of getting sick. While this is somewhat valid since there’s a pandemic, they are taking it to the extreme. They started wearing a mask around their family who they live with, even though none of them are high risk. They tried to get me and their family to wear masks around each other at all times too. They even asked me to quit my business so we could go to his families summer home to isolate until a vaccine comes out. Obviously I can’t quit my job, I have bills to pay and need to feed myself somehow. I have done everything I can to be there for my partner, though there’s only so much I can really do. 

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, and it’s been very bad in the last few months since my business is struggling and I can’t seem to recover. That paired with not being able to see my partner who I’ve been worrying about 24/7 has been rough. I want to be there for them through this hard time in their life, but I’m finding it hard because I’m so emotional right now. My partner is usually the one who is there for me when I am going though a rough patch, but now they have to focus on themselves so Ive lost them as a part of my support system. 

It feels like nothing good has happened is such a long time and things keep getting worse and worse. It’s becoming too much for me to handle. I have a history of self harm, I punch my thighs repeatedly and sometimes my head. Tonight I was triggered by a conversation I had with my partner. I was trying to support them while they were panicking in the hospital, and I became overwhelmed and started venting to them. They didn’t respond to anything I said and I got upset because it felt like they didn’t care. I punched myself repeatedly on my thighs and got extremely close to cutting myself which is something I’ve never done, mostly because I’m squeamish. 

I just don’t know how to deal with all of this anymore. I’m trying my best to get more business, but at this point I’m looking into getting a part time job since I’m not making much progress and I need the money. My partner is hurting and I feel like I’m being a horrible partner to them because I keep making everything about me and my depression instead of putting my problems aside so I can be supportive of them while they are in a behavioral hospital. I know they are struggling and don’t have the time to think about me and my problems, but I keep getting upset anyways when they don’t acknowledge me or my feelings. I almost feel like they would be better off without me in their life, I’m so selfish and negative all the time. I’m just a hindrance to the progress they are trying to make to become better...

My mother has anxiety. She was professionally diagnosed with it after she moved to Canada. She had told me it was from stress of raising me by herself, and her abusive ex boyfriend.

My current step-father is a rather calm, chill and relaxed guy. He has done questionable things to me, said odd things— has random depressive episodes that last for weeks.. his anger issues are crazy, he's a liar.
I have a big feeling I have depression. Whether it's mild, severe, I don't know. Anytime I try to bring up my mental health to my mom, she simply tells me it's because of my hormones, or 'cause my period will start soon. She will tell me it's a phase, or im on the internet too much. I'm seeking attention is all that she sees.
When I tell my dad, he simply tells me I'm just a very sensitive person. And honestly he's not wrong, im very sensitive. I get hurt or offended easily.
Or, they both tell me I'm lazy. Thats it.

Tldr: dad was abusive, now he's a better person and we have a fair relationship. Want to reconcile and request his support as a step for my mental health. Don't know if asking to reflect the past together, is a selfish act. 

--- 

Background 

I've had chronic depression and anxiety for 12 years now, had three attempts. Since my second attempt I've been hospitalised and formally diagnosed with MDD and MAD around 4 years ago. I am on and off with professional help, but currently I'm keeping with my medication and psychotherapy. 

I have good relationship with my mom, which prevented me from doing the first attempt. She knows about my condition, but not my two little sisters nor my father. I have good relationship with my sisters, but I don't want to burden them with this information and make them feel bad for their big bro. 

My father on other hand, was extremely harsh when I was young. I want to believe that I have forgiven him for making me who I am right now, but still I cannot shake that thought. My feeling say forgive, my thoughts says the past cannot be changed and he was a bad parent. 

We have uhhh, a currently fair relationship. He have changed, even though he still speak like a big mouthed cunt, his action have changed to a better father and even owed his mistakes to me. We have significantly different political view, but we respect each other. His support made me land my dream career which require a lot of financial support. I can genuinely say I love him directly and he said to me back, but in the past he was violent and we had fist fights and shed our blood on each other's. I fought him because I reached a breaking point of being physically abused. Shouted, slapped, whipped, knife directed at me. 

I learned to use my fist and my teeth to defend myself in school learning from him. Even with short stature, it was not courage, but a blood-lust that made looking to fight my bullies every Friday during elementary school (mind you I'm in different country. I seldomly experience any direct consequence). Eventually innocent schoolmates were involved. I always justify that I am defending myself, but at certain point I've become the bully. Growing up I despise that phase and ran to different school for fresh start, but I'm still struggling to get past that even today. A part of my condition is having relational commitment issues, one being of amplified fear of harming anyone that cared about me. 

When my father asked my forgiveness for being abusive, he justified that my grandpa did it to my father too. 

My father is not only a subject of my condition, but I think this is the more relevant point of discussion.

---

Additional information

I have daily suicidal thoughts which circles around my past, and the fear of becoming a harming again. I have my way out ready within my reach. However, I'm always reminded about my little sisters as reason to live. 

I don't have any lasting friends because I have a tendency to burn bridges. I had a group of good friends, which I left because I slipped out about my condition from being *subconscious* drunk. I maintain a facade and don't want others to feel responsible for me. 

I never fought since high school, except from a mutual road rage in my adulthood.. Which shamefully I enjoyed. 

---

Discussion

But in the end, I think I need to be honest to others, I need to accept that I cannot do this by myself. My mental problems emerge from me making own assumptions and conclusion, which frequently led to self destructive reasoning. And I'm thinking if opening up to my father, would be a process of reconciliation (?) 

My mom is pretty adamant that I should not open up to him. It seems that my father also have mental issues, and she doesn't want us to be both unstable. He's working in a job with high suicide rate. 

I just want my inner circle to be unbroken. It's been an arduous and too long of a process. I don't like to blame anyone except myself, but at this point I need to be honest to myself that there are external things that made me like this. My struggle is knowing how to be at peace with that. 

So my questions are: should I be honest to my father about my condition? Should I even tell him that his past parenting contributes to my condition? Would that worsen our relationship? Am I selfish to tell him that? Should I continue keeping my silence and work it out myself? 

Maybe tangent: should I barge in unsolicited to the lives I've harmed, and say my regrets for being a violent child? If you were bullied, would you forgive me if I say that I deserved the constant suffering (karma if you believe so) due to my actions against you?

,depression,"TW//Mention of SH

I worked at Legoland for a 3rd party company until March 16th when we closed indefinitely. I went without a job but was lucky enough to qualify for FL's unemployment and I was fine. 

I started working from home with an insurance company on July 6th and while I was training, I thought that I had found something that I could do for life. Then they let us get on the phones with actual customers and my anxiety and intrusive thoughts kicked into overdrive. I started having frequent anxiety attacks and I was hyperventilating after every rocky call. I sounded fine (according to my managers and my mother who could hear me from the living room) but I couldn't focus and I was constantly going over in break time because I couldn't calm down from my anxiety attack. Then around the beginning of September I started missing work. I would wake up exhausted and once I sat at my desk, the thoughts started. It was getting so bad that I had seriously considered self-harm which at that point I had been clean from for just over a year. I got terminated from that job in October when I couldn't produce a doctor's note diagnosing me with anxiety (I've never been able to afford therapy or a Dr's visit). 

My mother, who has never understood mental illness, took it terribly and eventually it lead to me writing a 4-page long note to her, explaining my depression and anxiety and telling her why it was so hard for me to work there. She tried to understand, but I can tell the bottom line is that I need to grow up and stop letting depression hold me back from getting a job. She still doesn't get it.

End of October I started work as a substitute teacher. I would pick the grade and school and I was totally in control of when and how I worked. I realize now that this was a TERRIBLE idea for me. I feel pathetic saying this but I've only worked ONE day as a substitute teacher. It was a great day, don't get me wrong. But I can't physically make myself do it again. I don't know if anyone understands what I mean by that but it's like all I can tell myself is that it doesn't matter what I do because I'm going to fuck it up eventually just like I always do.

I joke around with my online friends and tell them how depressed I am (omg quirky) but I can't cope and nothing that I did before is helping me anymore. The person I used to call my best friend is slowly distancing herself from me and realized that she thought that I was ""fake"". I found out, thanks to supportive and kind friends, that she was toxic and a bad person for me. 

I haven't made car payments in months. I can't make my car insurance payment from November and I'm lucky enough they let me postpone it another 15 days. But I can't find another job. I apply everywhere and hear nothing back. I'm only 19 so I obviously don't have much experience but I figured since I have a college degree I'd at least have some sort of an upper hand. I graduated from high school and college in 2019. They told me that I'd get a great job with my AA and that it could help me get closer to my bachelor's. But I feel hopeless and I feel like a disappointment. I'm turning 20 in less than 3 days and all I feel like I've wasted my life. I haven't done anything with my education and I can't get out of this stupid pit I'm in. My mother still doesn't understand and she just sees me as lazy and unwilling to try and work. But I can't afford to get out of here and I can't afford to lose my car.

I'm self-destructive and I can't express how much it hurts to go from ""such a smart young lady"" to ""a depressed child"". I feel like the people in my life are only tolerating me until I finally get the hint and just remove myself from their lives. I haven't ranted to them because I'm supposed to be the strong one. I help other people so I don't have to think about myself but I can't do this anymore. I'm 0 days clean. I need therapy or meds or something. I miss being able to distract myself from toxic thoughts and I miss being happy. I feel like such a fuckup. 

I doubt anyone will read this and even if they do I doubt they'll get this far. But if you do, thank you for listening. And also sorry you had to listen.

My mom died this month. She was in Hospice in my home. She live with me a few years before she passed. Last year in November she was sick and hospitalized. They intubated her. She was there for about 3 weeks. I thought I lost her. 

She came home but was basically bed ridden for the last year of her life. 

I was mean to her right before she died. She kept moaning and I hadn't slept for weeks and I yelled at her asking her what she needed. I had been hand feeding her and caring for her around the clock alone. Every time I would fall asleep she would call for me or moan loud enough to wake me. I hadn't  slept in days...After that she became silent and didn't or couldn't communicate for almost 3 days before she passed. 

In June I lost my dog who was 17 years old. I rescued him from and abusive home when he was 6 months old. No matter how much love he had, he died never wanting to look you in the eye. He was my 55 pound lap dog and the best animal I ever had. When he was close to the end he could barely stand and I syringe fed him and gave him fluids.

In March I lost my cat who was 10. He threw a blood clot which was something I had never heard of before. He screamed and howled in pain for an hour and died in the car on the way to the emergency vet.

My Grandfather died July 2nd 2018. He was my person. My mother had a breakdown after I was born and at 6 months old I was thrown into his arms and he took care of me. We bonded. So much so that he carried me on his arm so much and so long he tore ligaments and had to have surgery. I clearly recall being 4 and him telling me he couldn't carry me any longer and the fit that transpired. 

I had moved away and had a life but when he became ill I moved 1500 miles back home to care for him. I did it for 4 years while working full time and raising my child. As soon as I started receiving financial aid for caring for him my Aunt swooped in, forced me out and I never saw him again. He died 8 months later. 

My son spoke to him on his birthday a month before he died and he used a key word we had. He said ""Pa is surrounded by all these women, but I'd rather be with you kids. Know papa loves you.""

I am sooo sad and broken. My entire foundation is gone. My son is 18. I know I have to be his rock. His home. But I am so, so, so sad. I don't know how to keep going.

&lt;p&gt;I had moved away and had a life but when he became ill I moved 1500 miles back home to care for him. I did it for 4 years while working full time and raising my child. As soon as I started receiving financial aid for caring for him my Aunt swooped in, forced me out and I never saw him again. He died 8 months later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son spoke to him on his birthday a month before he died and he used a key word we had. He said &amp;quot;Pa is surrounded by all these women, but I&amp;#39;d rather be with you kids. Know papa loves you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sooo sad and broken. My entire foundation is gone. My son is 18. I know I have to be his rock. His home. But I am so, so, so sad. I don&amp;#39;t know how to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for the rant. But I needed to vent.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate my fucking life, I really do.
I want to die.
I dont want to kill myself because im scared it will hurt, but, I want to be dead.
Everyday I wake up feeling ashamed, disappointed and utterly disgusted by myself, im a horrible human being and if anyone knew the truth about me they'd feel the same way.
Every waking moment I feel as if im on the verge of tears, and the verge of suicide.
Whats the point of living, honestly? 
I have two options, die, get it over with
Or
Live, a sad, pathetic and lonesome life.
People don't understand me, or how I feel nor can I explain it to them.
I was asked by my nan why im so aggressive, she asked me to stop being so serious and stay light hearted, but, its not that easy.
People make it out like it is, that you just have to do it, but I have no will.
Everyday is the same, wake up, masturbate, maybe brush teeth and wash face, read manga about some guy transporting to a different world where he's happy, feel like shit, masturbate, read, play video games, masturbate, eat, masturbate, play games, read manga, masturbate, maybe wash face and brush teeth, read manga, masturbate and sleep. Wow what an amazing life, my brains plagued with the feel of anxiety, the feeling of being easily overpowered, if only life was easy, you know, I would love to get up one day and say ""fuck this! Im gonna fight to be happy, I gonna eat healthy, get new hobbies, stop masturbating and love myself"" maybe one day I'll be transported to an a different world likes those people in the mangas I read, if only it was that simple.
Misery is all I feel apart from emptiness, I could be saying this all because im sad tonight, or I could just be speaking realistically, im sad, alone and tired, so very tired, I can only go so far, im weak, im not strong like other people, maybe (guy) was right, maybe I would amount to nothing, if only I could just move far away where the people I once knew would never come.
I was happy for a short while recently, being told (girl1) had been trying to reach me, it felt like a hand coming out the darkness, we spoke on the phone, she misses me, funny that, those words made me so happy, every time I think I hate her she says such simple shit and I feel like I love her, I cant tell if its admiration, envy or love, ironic I know. I still speak to guy1 and guy2, I miss bestguy a lot, the only friend that would stick up for me, yet, im never there when he needs me, I'm a shitty friend, guy1, guy2, guy3, guy4
No one sticks up for me, they act like they do, maybe they did at one point, but, ironically not when I needed them to, and yet I know if bestguy was there he would smack the shit outta everyone, and yet, I cant even thank him for being my friend, what a pathetic life I live, sitting on my arse writing this shit like im some fucking edgy anime character how pitiful can I get, not that it matters, (support woman) no help either, like talking to someone would help me feel whole, funny.
Im just waffling into a random document, in my head im thinking I wonder what these will think of this, wondering if I should show them, I wonder what reaction they'd give, not that it matters.
My life is going no where and everytime I fall into this pit I let my self sink with the hope one day I won't come back up and ill die a peaceful death.
Do I want to die?
I dont know, but I certainly don't want to live.
All I do is give into my selfish desires, im such a creepy weirdo, using (girl1) for far material because she said she missed me, what the fuck is wrong with me, not that that's the worst thing I've done, its just pitiful to think I'd give so much emotion to someone as if I mean fuckall to them, like I said, im tired, the same mental battle everyday, I always lose, I just want to be happy, like I mean something, maybe I just want pity, maybe I want to feel loved, maybe I want to stop being a control freak, maybe I want to sort out my short fuse, maybe I want a family that makes me feel loved, maybe I want a mother that treats me as a son, maybe I want a dad that taught me how to be a man, maybe a want a girlfriend who will hug and tell me its alright, maybe I want a life that doesn't kick me to the floor and spit on me, maybe i want to stop writing my desires on a phone at 4:37 in the fucking morning and do something that means something, im nearly sixteen and I want to show people I mean something, I dont want to be forgotten but also I want to be a normal sixteen year old, I dont want to have to do my gcses in 2022, I dont want to be alone anymore, I want people to like me, I want to like people and I want to stop being a bitch, i get called sensitive all the time, I get called lanky, I get called a rapist, I get called a nonce, I get called a sex offender, I get called a dog fucker, I get called a spotty nonce for what?

,depression,"Too long to read sorry

 I am a 20 year old girl living with my parents and 3 siblings and sis in law in Nyc. I am currently a full time student at CUNY and I have always been financially dependent on my father. I was spoiled and treated like a princess durinf my childhood days( they dont know abt the trauma i endured when i was a child i still keep it a secret bc ik my parents will not act rationally)I don't currently work because my parents do not permit me to do so. I do need permission to go outside, they limit me on how long i can be out for, who am i working with, im not allowed to work in fast food or retail, office job is fine as long as i come home before sun sets. Im not allowed to wear the clothes i feel comfortable in even tho they are not anywhere near unmodest. Even in my own house i am expected to dress modestly. (No skin, no tight clothes, not too loose) They limit my means to earn and so I don't have but much saved up. I cannot up and leave my family as they are very susceptible to the backlash they probably will face if I just leave. I can find refuge in fam members houses but i will be found if i go to those places and my parents will force me back home and they will start problems with them. I can remove myself and end up in a domestic violence shelter but i dont want to put myself at risk for covid and im not even escaping any imminent physical harm, but its a likely possibility w them. Im confident i can take care if myself because i take care of my family. I prioritize my fam. Mt oarenrs believe women are infefior to men and must rely on a man. They see my emotional sensitivity as weakness. Every mistake i have made is held on to forever. (Mistakes that are not even mistakes like gettinf a piercing without their permission when i was 19. MY MOM HAS THE SAME PIERCING) my mom is diff from my dad but not really. She was a child bride and the processing of her trauma is evident in her behavior and speech. For example she ignored me for 11 days once bc i went outside to get dinner w some friends. I hadnt been outside in 3 weeks. I was not posing a risk but she was upset bc my dad allowed me to go. The anger is misplaced whatever) Even before the pandemic, I had a normal life of a muslim bengali girl, even better than most daughters that deal with similar situations.but my parents have made the decision to get me married even before I have completed my studies. I have the option to say no, however, I'm also told that I am not allowed to be independent until i am married. Im explicity told im being taken care of till marriage. They will not accept someone that doesnt adhere to their liking, and they like no one. (Seriously)Literally dont like anyone. They srranged my brothers marriage to my first cousin. (Diff story) they wont force me to marry my cousin dw but they will be so particular and they are not happy with anyone elses choices. If i refuse their choice they will feel insulted, they will twist things to make it seem like i am trying to go against their wishes (accuse me of straying from Islam, having a secret bf) they will guilt trip me. It so sad bc i am expected to smile when i see them and look so happy but everytime i see them i want to cry. They dont care about how we feel boo hoo.There are many things I can do , like just leave and depend on myself. Give in and be unhappy. Fight back and see the consequences of my actions. If i go against their wishes, I don't know the consequences. It can be violent as my parents have put their hands on me. (rare) They scream, humiliate, manipulate, gaslight me and my older sibling. They take their anger out on other ppl and we have to let them .They forces us to be dependent on them so if we dont listen to them, we have no means to support ourselves. Yes, my job is to finish my education and look for a job. Work, save your money, and leave. This is what I am trying to accomplish. I dont want to be like them.My mental health has been deteriorating for years and i have been receiving medication and counseling for as a treatment plan however, I still deal with this interpersonal violence and have to continue to endure it till my parents arrange my marriage to someone of their standards. I take antidepressants just to control mt emotions because i would not be able to get out of bes sometimes or focus on anything without crying in between. My main goal to reach the means to support myself and have some slace. I have had job offers that my parents have left me no choice to decline. (he took me out of the country). My parents have found out that i have some money saved up and now they expect me to contribute to household expenses while i dont hold a job. Im not allowed to be independent but im doing things that independent adults are doing for themselves. This makes it hard for me to accumulate money without having a steady income. Though they are not against my education, but they have very less interest in my studies and they have planned my life out for me and I'm to follow. They let me study whatever because they know that i will end up with a man that will support me financially etc. that may sound less awful but i like someone and my parents will never accept him. (This is important but not rn)My older brother who is married and has dealt with this situation but didnt fight back advised me to find someone of my liking (must be Muslim, preferably bengali unless i want to deal with even more drama)and find him soon unless i want to stay and deal with my parents and taking care of children and house responsibilities and remote schooling which they always neglect to give me an environment to study. My sis in laws housework can almost be considered a 9-5 in return she lives as a family member and is provided for. When she has the baby, i know i will be expected to care for the child bc my parents wont allow a break from her responsibilities. ( she has HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDAUM AND MY PARENTS THINK ITS LAZINESS LOL)I schedule take everyone to all their appointments, everyones. All 6 other members of my family. My youngest little brother has FOP disease and its so hard for me to see him be so miserable in his own home. My other little brother has a learning disability that my parents misunderstand for misbehaving and just being immature and lazy. In my own room, its hard to study when i cant even read a paragraph because everyone in the house is screaminf. I have to turn off my camera and mic because ppl will suddenly come in ans out and scream and it could sound very concerning. Its so hard to explain to my professors how much this is taking a toll on me.Idk how to focus when my parents pull me out class or my work to do things for them. Ofc i have tried to set boundaries but they gaslight me into making me feel like i dont do enough for the family. I have been coparenting my mother in raising two young kids since i was 11. Ive been completing all the paperwork that goes on in the house, whethere its expecting to pay bills on time for my father, expecting to help my pregnant sis in law because she doesnt know english. I am fully responsible for my two younger brothers education and health.  Sometime i find them making me help someone else (outside the fam)bc my father promised them i would do this for them, without even asking me. I do most of the communication for my father and im expected to do these. If i dont then i am an ungrateful. That i dont prioritize them. They guilt trip us.  And i have never said no. I dont speak back bc then they will punish me. It quite possibly can get physical but its usually them screaming their lungs out, insulting me, They have me in psychological chains. No, there is not much physical abuse I am to escape them, but everyday gets harder and harder for me to continue. I'm limited in what I can do. I have a physically disabled sibling, another younger sibling, a pregnant sister in law that is also forced to depend of my parents, and my older brother, who is also in the same position but he works with my father. My responsibilities as the daughter is to follow my mother and sis in law in their routine which is fine with me. But they have always tried to keep me inside the house and away from other people, including other family members, friends etc since adolescence . I'm not allowed outside the house for more than an hour a day, even when i have responsibilities. If i am away for even one hour, not a second goes by before they begin to call me phone and demand i leave whatever im doing and come home. If i dont i can expect a period of yelling, stern lecturing, and they restrict me even more. It has been difficult trying to balance school, complete training, trying to find work, taking care of my family fulltime aswell, and maintaining my mental health. Yes, I get there are strategies to deal with these kinds of situations however, I see very little hope in the ability to live an independent life. If i dont follow my parents instructions, i will be left alone and will be left to support myself. This pandemic has heightened all the stress and intensity and leaves me in a sulken depressed state. No amount of medicine or therapy will help me escape this situation. I have to be there for my siblings and my sister in law. The gender based violence may not always be physical, but everyone in my home is miserable. To have our own parents twist our arm till we give in. I am feeling so hurt writing this and i don't know where to go or what to do. If my parents introduce me to a potential suitor(s), i will be expected to choose now or delay until i have finish my studies. Regardless, there is not sign of willingness to allow me, their only daughter, make a decision for myself. Never happened, never will happen under his roof. what can i do? Should i complete my studies and find a job and leave. This will lead them to possibly disowning me. May forbid me to see my family members that rely on my support, maybe not moneywise but theres no one in the house to advocate for my younger siblings that need diff type of attention and environment that they are not receiving. My sis in law has always fallen to being the housewife and is expected to do her daily chores and cook and clean ans maintain the house and the family.  She has never worked and is discouraged from pursuing education and now she is pregnant with no means to support herself and her baby unless its relying on my brother who ultimately also depends on the money my father gives him. I am discouraged from working bc it takes me away from the home and taking care of the family and its not “necessary” since my parsnts provide for me but they dont really care that i have to work, to build my resume, to enhance my education, to financially provide for myself. They say i can work online and i have been having such a hard time finding s remote jobs with the qualifications i have which is not many. I decided i will pay for medical assistant classes so that i can be certified and have some help finding jobs, even so, i dont know if my parents will ultimately work after I completed. They expect me to finish the classes but they are telling me i cant go to work in a hospital. Ofc I understand the risk of bringing home Covid19, but this is what is masking their actual reason is that they dont want me to earn. Women are to take care of the household and they can work if they want to but as long as it doesnt come between her “responsibilities”. This is so maddening. They are not only like this to me and my siblings but everyone in our family including their siblings, their siblings families, cousins etc. everyone is always left quiet bc whenever anyone stands up to my parents, my parents will bash them, humiliate, if they can maybe even slap them. They will always put them in their place which they believe is at their feet. And its sad to say that i will have to continue living like this because i am to follow my religion in this household and my religion tells me that i must obey my parents. Yeah it also says u cant trwat ppl like shit but like i said, my parents will never let someone speak over them about anything. Sorry i dont want to read this over snd skim for mistakes but im grateful for the house i live in, the food i eat, my loving siblings, i love my parents snd they love me. But we will never be on the same page because they don’t respect anyone but expect to be treated like royalty. Im not even asking for advice but i am always labelled as dramatic but this is my life. At the end of the day, no one can detect any resentment from me bc i keep a smile on my face and im obedient to my parents.

They are not only like this to me and my siblings but everyone in our family including their siblings, their siblings families, cousins etc. everyone is always left quiet bc whenever anyone stands up to my parents, my parents will bash them, humiliate, if they can maybe even slap them. They will always put them in their place which they believe is at their feet. And its sad to say that i will have to continue living like this because i am to follow my religion in this household and my religion tells me that i must obey my parents. Yeah it also says u cant trwat ppl like shit but like i said, my parents will never let someone speak over them about anything. Sorry i dont want to read this over snd skim for mistakes but im grateful for the house i live in, the food i eat, my loving siblings, i love my parents snd they love me. But we will never be on the same page because they don’t respect anyone but expect to be treated like royalty. Im not even asking for advice but i am always labelled as dramatic but this is my life. At the end of the day, no one can detect any resentment from me bc i keep a smile on my face and im obedient to my parents. Lets hope this job search gets a little easier and these essays get written quickly😞&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So I have had a lot of debates on myself when it comes to my mental health and I almost feel like I have no idea where to categorize myself. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but always felt like something was missing. 

I grew up around a lot of chaos, not in my immediate family but with cousins/aunt/uncles. Lost a lot of very dear and influential family members in my childhood and was bullied to the point of self harm in the sixth grade. I was more of an outcast in my early teens, and in high school my parents divorced. 

My dad was never really involved and things took a turn when my mom left and my sister ( who was 22 ) decided to stay living with my dad. Over the course of three years, my dad became mentally abusive, rude, explosive, my sister moved out and I pretty much dropped out of school. We never had food in the house and I ended up telling him one morning that I was leaving, because I had bad suicidal thoughts the night prior. 

My mom and I have worked our asses off but we have struggled a lot the last year and I feel like my mental health has taken a turn and I'm starting to really think about things. 

I have panic attacks weekly, nightmares since I was a kid, sometimes cry/breakdown and have conversations with myself out loud, sometimes almost as if I'm working things out w someone. Speaking in front of people on my own gives me mouth and body twitches and I always feel exhausted. I have really bad mood swings and am really self conscious to the point where most days it consumes me. It feels like my head and thoughts don't stop from the moment I wake up till I fall asleep. I just feel so lost, especially with myself.

Pretty much open to any opinions or insight on this, as my family and doctor have struggled with it and is always considered regular anxiety/depression.

,depression,"Hello, this is my first post on Reddit because I just don’t know what to do anymore. For some background on me (21F), I’ve been depressed for 10 years now and I’ve been diagnosed with severe depressive disorder. I started going to therapy this year but it’s just not working. I tried antidepressants but I had an awful reaction that landed me in the ER and I thought I was going to die. Now I’m scared to try antidepressants again. I am now the worst I have ever been. Everything is too much of a burden and I don’t care if I lose everything. I sleep all day and I can’t do anything. I’m not eating and I feel like I’m going to pass out or like I’m “high.” I can’t bring myself to eat or do anything. I don’t think I can bring myself to go to work. I feel like I’m going crazy because usually when I get extremely depressed I hear voices (although I know they’re not real) and it freaks me out. I don’t have a lot of support.

For some background on me (21F), I’ve been depressed for 10 years now and I’ve been diagnosed with severe depressive disorder. I started going to therapy this year but it’s just not working. I tried antidepressants but I had an awful reaction that landed me in the ER and I thought I was going to die. Now I’m scared to try antidepressants again. I am now the worst I have ever been. Everything is too much of a burden and I don’t care if I lose everything. I sleep all day and I can’t do anything. I’m not eating and I feel like I’m going to pass out or like I’m “high.” I can’t bring myself to eat or do anything. I don’t think I can bring myself to go to work. I feel like I’m going crazy because usually when I get extremely depressed I hear voices (although I know they’re not real) and it freaks me out. I don’t have a lot of support. The only support I really have is my friend and my brother and they don’t know what to do with me. I lost a lot of friends this year. My mom ignores or denies my mental health even when I try to talk about it. She knows I’ve been in bed for days and doesn’t say anything.

,depression,"Ok, I realize that this may not be the best place to post this. But I *am* depressed, and I know there are a ton of active users on this sub. So I'm hoping that someone will see this ASAP and lend me a hand.

Here's the deal. I'm an alcoholic. I've been struggling with alcoholism for years (I'm only 19), but this weekend it has become apparent to me that I'm a literal, actual alcoholic. I blacked out last night and woke up in panic, wondering what I had done the night before. Luckily, I didn't do anything that serious (aside from sending a few embarrassing text messages). But even so, I couldn't even make it 3 hours before my shaky hands and panic attacks became too much. I started drinking at 2PM, which is unfortunately commonplace for me at this point.

Anyway, I have work tomorrow. Obviously I can't be drunk during the day, but my withdrawal symptoms are too intense to ignore. So what do I do? On top of that, I'm broke as fuck so I can't even afford to keep buying more booze. I spent $15 on a mickey today, and that's probably the last I can afford for the next week and a half.

So I'm really fucking worried about what I'm gonna do tomorrow. I also have a freelance side project lined up for this week, and that's gonna be just as big of a problem.

The reason I'm drinking so much these days is because I'm trying to cut down on my weed intake. Can you believe that? I replaced one addiction with a different, more serious one. Unbelievable. But anyway, the point is that I don't think I'll be able to make it through the day without getting uncontrollable anxiety due to withdrawal.

I know there are other depressed, alcoholic fucks on this sub, so I'm asking for your help. How am I supposed to survive the day tomorrow? Not only can I not afford it, but I'm just really scared that I'll do something stupid if I don't ""get my fix"". Maybe I'll borrow more money and add onto the 3k+ mountain of debt that I already have. Maybe I'll steal a bottle from the liquor store and get sent to jail. Maybe I'll rob an innocent old lady for 20 bucks just so I can buy some vodka. Fuck.

How am I supposed to do this? I really don't fucking know how I'm gonna survive tomorrow. I don't *think* I'm gonna kill myself, but who knows, maybe the pain will get so bad that I'll have no other option.

Rehab? Maybe. But I can't afford to take that much time off from work. All I have in this world is my apartment and personal space, and I won't be able to maintain those things if I get fired. I'll have to move back in with my parents, and while they're certainly supportive, that is one of the **last** things I want to do right now.

Just- help. If you have any advice to provide, please do. And for the love of God, don't be like my friends and suggest ""just stop drinking"". It's not that fucking simple. So please.

,depression,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",t2_8yhmtnvn,False,,0,False,I can’t live with my guilt from being a catfish,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k3ody2,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606737837.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD&lt;/p&gt;

I used to not be depressed, or at least never admit it, and for good reason; that's like a curse word to black parents.

To top it off, it seems like my tiny world is imploding with so many unforeseen challenges, and I can&amp;#39;t deal with any of it. Overwhelmed doesn&amp;#39;t scratch the surface. 
So, in comes the voice that&amp;#39;s reasons how much easier things would be to leave this world. Have peace without condition or struggle. To be clear, I have no plan of killing myself, but have been semi-obsessed with the solitude that comes with death. When you encounter what feels like a struggle ( or three) at each turn, it seems only natural to want for something simpler. I also know there are people that are more deserving of these feelings besides myself. I just felt it was time to get things off my chest. Maybe I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel so alone.

&lt;p&gt;But either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really just want to cry into someone&amp;#39;s arms and feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone to hug me while I calm down and just let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cant even cry anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t trust anyone in my life to handle these feelings it’s easier to just vent to total strangers. I feel completely alone in my self loathing, so I don’t initiate contact with anyone because I don’t feel like I’m worth their time; I don’t want to bother them. And my life on paper is great...I’m just miserable feeling like I’m not living, just going through the motions. Then comes the guilt from having these feelings...I absolutely hate that I feel this way, which only makes the depression worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bawled for a solid 20 minutes today, both of my kids asked my why I was crying. I had no idea what to tell them. I should be happy, but I don’t even know what to do with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

​

The point is i'm sick of it. im sick of feeling like this. I've genuinely had enough.

A lot of kind people have given me help and advice, however this help has gotten me nowhere, even though I know it helps others to overcome their mental issues. Someone please help me. 

my issues:

\- No motivation. Struggle to even get out of bed in the morning.

\- Plenty of things that I want/need to do but just can't be assed.

\- feeling down for absolutely no reason.

\- Intrusive thoughts 

\- General negativity and pessimism for no real reason. I can't think about ANYTHING in a positive way anymore, I only see negatives.

\- Worrying: I worry about upsetting or burdening people with my issues. I worry that nobody cares. I worry that I'm going to make the people that I care about worry over me. I worry that my mental state isn't getting better; which quite frankly, it isnt.

- decline. I used to talk to myself all the time to help process simple things like how my day went as well as anything negative going on in my life. This doesn't help me deal with it anymore and if anything makes it worse, like many of the other techniques that the people of reddit have suggested. (such as journaling).

​

That's an overall summary. Please feel free to ask me questions or give me advice, absolutely anything is very much appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s me, or if it&amp;#39;s because of the transitions this year due to the virus, or if it&amp;#39;s just because I am lonely. Maybe all of the above, but it&amp;#39;s only worsening and I am really doing everything I can to try and help myself. I got a new job, I put in a new school next semester, I just got a new car, and I really have gotten my shit together. But sometimes I am lonely, and I do drugs. I smoke weed every day. I know I&amp;#39;m probably making things worse but it&amp;#39;s just so hard sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;

She knows I suffer from depression. I cry almost every day wishing I never meant this girl because I don’t want to break up with her because she said she would kill herself if I did. Her mean attitude also caused her to lose all her friends. And I know it would devestate her if I left.

Its all about immediate success when you’re young, depression and anxiety is massive in young people, we’re literally dying. There’s no long term plan. I would say i have generalized anxiety disorder, bc i worry a lot about things.. and often i feel depressed and want to die. But im pretty sure i am smart enough to go to college and there’s no reason i should be living here in some dump shitting myself everyday. I can literally not even stand people, i have literally no coping mechanism. I feel like a failure and i remember everything people say and do. How do i ever achieve anything.. i blown my chances&lt;/p&gt;

For as long as I can remember, I've been the ""quiet, mature kid"". Most people don't talk to me because I'm very ""robotic"", and when they do they either get bored or try to use me as a tool.

Each year has only made me feel more and more alienated from my peers because I can't really feel things; I don't punch things in anger, I don't jump for joy, I don't cry in sadness.

If feel like shit. All day. Every day. There's a part of me that's broken; someplace deep in my brain. The part that makes me move. The part that allows me to focus. The part that's crucial for happiness... yeah... that parts gone.

I'm a shell. A husk. Not even fully human. The light that shines inside the rest of you, mine has faded to dying embers.

You know what it's like, don't you? If your reading this, I'm sure you understand.

You understand the darkness. How its cold embrace is so familiar and inviting... a promise of a warm blanket hidden inside cold lies and empty tomorrows. The grey swollen clouds hang over head always. There is no sun, no joy, no happiness... just the cold dark.

The worst part of it all?

I'm smart.

I'm talking Mensa Candidate smart.

I could have been anything: a surgeon, a pilot, an astronaut, an architect, a lawyer... hell... I could have been president.

But the darkness... My god... its grip is like a vice. It holds so tightly, so completely... it feels like its impossible to break free.

You feel it too, don't you. Like part of you; the part that wants to be free and happy, the part that yearns for joy and life and fulfillment... It's in there... deep inside, locked in a box and trapped in the dark, screaming, yelling, crying to be free... silent in the unending darkness.

I made a plan. 

I sat down and planned it all out...

My life.

Some exercise here, some work there, some time to save and build and focus...

It would take about nine months. It would be hard... but oh so easy. It's just time, after all. Time we all have. Time we all take for granted.

And I would be happy. I would be fit. I would be successful. I would be a new man.

I showed the plan to the darkness and it laughed.

\*""No.""\* it whispered. \*""Stay here. Stay right where you are. Why leave? You know what's at the end of that road. Pain. Disappointment. Heartache. And me. even if you try... even if you take those first steps... I'll be there. I'll always be there. You will never be free of me. I am with you... always.""\*

I cried. Tears of pain, and rage, and hallow wishes.

I prayed. Prayed to a God, any God, not believing in any of them.

I sit here now, slowly killing myself, slowly allowing the darkness to consume me.

\*Do I taste good, fucker?\*

I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of hoping. No more wishes. No more plans.

No more.

Fight your battle, if you must. I'm rooting for you. But my fight is done.

I lost.

I lost hope. I lost the will. I lost myself.

There's only the dark now... and soon... there will be death.

I have failed. My greatest fear has been realized.

I am nothing even though I have everything: A great wife. Good kids. A nine to five. Talent... my god... the talent. I'm handsome. I wont be gracing the cover of any magazines, but women look twice. Family. Friends. They are there too...

 But the darkness turns it into nothing, it makes me focus on whats not, instead of appreciating what is.

What a jest the universe has played; to bare you into a world of light and song and joy and love and potential and possibilities... and then saddles you with this dark passenger; this endless whisper... this eternal torment.

Perhaps I will find peace in the boundless nothing that comes next.

It's quite there, I think. At least I wont hear the screaming of my dying soul anymore.

Earlier this year me and my SO of 8 years split up. We have 3 kids together. I stayed in the house we were living in (and she was helping me) until the beginning of this month. Fucking weird but I had to move back in with my parents. I haven't really seen them much in the past 8 years because of some crazy shit that went down when I was younger. Long story short, me and a woman back then had a kid, shit in my life hit the fan and I lost custody of him because I couldn't even afford to hardly take care of myself. Then my mom swooped in and just completely through me under the bus and took custody of him. Things were ok at first but we would get into heated arguments on ""who was the REAL father"". So over these past 8 years I haven't seen him much because my parents are just complete shit. But yet, here I am...after simply asking if I could stay here over the course of a couple months.   
Well now I don't get to see my daughters a whole lot either. I work 6 days a week ( because finding employment in my current situation is complete and utter garbage. ) so when I get to the house today I ask my mom if I couldn't go and pick up my girls tonight. (FYI my mom is the picture perfect fucking  narcissist ) She begins to spout out how ""school starts tomorrow again and this and that"". Basically her way of saying no. Just to build some context I was visiting my girls a couple nights ago and when I was about to leave they were crying and everything so I was like ok ok I will take you guys with me. Well when I get back to my parents house and go to say hello my mom gave me the fucking stink eye and starting going off about how she was sick and shit. So I ended up just getting me and my girls a hotel room so I could see them that night.

  
Idk...but this is all becoming too fucking much. Me being there for my girls means absolutely everything to me....but I have no way to see them...like...WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?!? I mean these people are so fucking petty that you can TASTE the fucking jealousy because my son (who has been with them these past 8 years) is so connected to me ( even though he doesn't know who the fuck I am ).

,depression,"This is a long post. Very long. I just needed to vent about everthring....

As the title suggest...I really don't know. I don't know if I can continue with what I feel is a hollow existence of mine.

These past couple of years have been horrible but like many of you might agree 2020 is hell. I started my year off on a sad foot because I stepped up to the plate to care for my terminal grandmother. She had 9 kids but none of them put their lives on hold for her. I did. I was already feeling like a failure because school didn't work out because my mother didn't file in time for my FASFA and it got so expensive I had to drop out my first semester. I was devastated. Now I owe the school over 5k and I can't to back to school until then.

Anyways, I came back to my hometown and carried for my grandmother because I love(d) her with all my being. I stayed those long, painful nights by her side. I was losing my mind watching my grandmother waste away. Meanwhile, I had not a cent to my name unless it was the little 100 dollars my mom sent twice a month. I was broke, didn't have a car, and was 24/7 caretaking. 

However, I didn't blame my grandmother but I started feeling guilty because I would want her pain to stop. I wanted her to go home and be at peace. I felt evil wishing her what she wanted,  death.

Then, when her kids finally came around she took her last breath. I was there. Like I promised her. I cleaned her up and got her ready for the hospices nurses to pronounce her time of death. 

I must admit there were days I would look at her kitchen knives, imaging that familiar sting and bite of a knife. This time though I didn't want to just feel the cuts. I wanted to feel Death wrap me in her sweet embrace. Then I would snap out of it and remember I was all my grandmother had in the end. She begged me not to ever leave her and I didn't. 

Since she has passed I know live with my mother...again. I love my mother but I don't really like her. 

When I first cut myself I had to be either 13 or 14. I was able to pull it off and lied and said the dog was scratching me. She believed me...until the cuts became more like carvings. 

My mother had a large wooden paddle she used on me and my brother. She beat me because I cut myself. My butt was swollen for days.  Funny thing is...my mother was a fucking psychology major who wanted to help adolescents. I always find that rich and ironic. 

There are plenty of things I resent her for and those are one. Anyways, I live with her and her long time partner. I hate it. I feel like a failure. I don't have a car, no license, nothing to show any success. 

Now I'm spending the holidays with my boyfriend and it's been the Hoildays of Hell. He hated the Thanksgiving meal I eagerly made him. Two days of laboring for him to say the only thing that was okay was the turkey. We've argued almost everyday since I've been here. He's rarely here, first it was him taking finals (I understood) now he's pulling as many shifts at work he possibly can. So, I'm alone at the house with no human interaction. I have no friends. I sit here and reflect on how I have failed and accomplish nothing. 

I quit my call Center job I had because the people were abusive, it was sickening. I got a job a really wanted but their training schedule is legit once a day every couple of days. The first check I got from them was 33 dollars. They only pay 10 dollars and hr. So, I'm crazy broke,  I have a weekly bill that I can no longer afford, and this is the first Chirstmas I won't be able to buy anyone anything. To top it all off Amazon overdrawed my account by almost 90 dollars for something I still haven't recived.

I try to count my blessings but each day they become lesser and lesser. I find myself in bed until the day is almost over. Not doing anything. It takes so much energy just to feed myself.....I just don't know anymore.

,depression,"Okay, this is probably going to be a long post/rant, but I need to write it for the sake of my sanity because this has caused me to spiral into a new level of depression and anxiety.

The last 2 years have been rough for me and my family (wife and 2 kids under 10). I left grad school 2 years ago while completing my PhD (which is now finally ready to submit this coming week so I can officially be done with it). We moved from the Northeast back down to the Southeastern US to live with my mother. We did this for several reasons, primarily because of financial limitations. During that timeframe, my wife began to notice some of my mom’s habits that were concerning (my wife is a mental health counselor). For the most part, I didn’t interpret them as quite so serious because they were mostly things like putting stuff away in weird places and losing everyday items (sometimes for days or even weeks at a time; things like keys and cell phone). We all lose shit from time to time and/or misplace things, so I just chalked most of it up to general absent-mindedness that comes with age for all of us. 

But shit really started to hit the fan about 6 months ago, and snowballed on us in the last 2 weeks. Since we had lived with my mom, she’s been convinced that people have been stealing things from her house. Her accusations were, at first, primarily levied against a couple of cousins and an aunt and uncle of mine, a couple of people in the neighborhood known to have stolen things in the past, and a shady woman that had lived with my mom for a short period before we moved in. It was impossible to prove any of these people had really stolen anything, so we just sort of listened to mom and tried to alleviate her concerns by telling her we would be mindful not to let anyone she suspected have access to the house. I even installed some security cameras and flood lights to go with a new backyard fence (I didn’t install the fence). A little security surely couldn’t hurt. 

Another part of the reason that we couldn’t prove any of the aforementioned people had stolen anything, was because most of the items mom claimed were constantly being stolen were things like batteries, light bulbs, laundry detergent, and other every-day use items. And to be clear, there were at least 2 valuable things that had gone missing but both of those items appear to have gone missing when the shady woman was living there (and we are convinced this woman stole at least those 2 things because others who also knew her have noted that she’s a thief). But the majority of the alleged items going missing, were not exactly the sort of thing one takes to a pawn shop for cash.

Fast forward to January 2020. Between being unemployed for several months, plus teaching online via Zoom once the Fall 2020 semester started, in addition to the pandemic/lockdown, I was home every single day. I know for a fact that there was no one coming into the house and stealing shit. But about 6 months ago, mom began to behave more erratically. In addition to the items being “stolen,” she was now also convinced that things were being broken on purpose, and that people where she works were conspiring against her to get her fired. She had cut off contact with several of her friends as well as some family members because she was convinced that they were part of it, and then she began to lash out at me, accusing me of being part of this all in some way. We had a big fight, which really only resulted in me being more confused, but I still (for the most part) believed her. After all, where she worked has a track record for forcing people into early retirement or get fired, and maybe some shit had been stolen since we had lived there because I certainly couldn’t prove otherwise. 

Then, about 2 weeks ago came the final straw that broke the camel’s back. Again, she blows up at me and my wife. She can’t list anything that’s been stolen since January when I’ve been home every day, but she’s still convinced stuff is being stolen and that we’re either allowing it to happen or actively helping in some way. She’s convinced that “they” are breaking things to fuck with her and make her feel insane, and in addition she accuses us of breaking things that are costing her massive amounts of money (never mind that the things that have broken since we’ve been there have been largely replaced by us and definitely haven’t come at her expense: like the oven/stovetop and garbage disposal). Now she’s directly of accusing us of working with a group of people to steal/break things to drive her insane. She even accuses us of either deleting videos from the cameras I installed or letting these co-conspirators have access to the cameras to delete the videos. That’s the only way she can justify the paucity of evidence from the cameras. She accuses us of working with people we don’t talk to, don’t know, have never met, or haven’t seen in decades. In her mind, her sister and brother-in-law (my aunt and uncle I mentioned previously) are working with people in the HR department plus supervisors where she works, plus the wife of an ex-husband, plus the people in the neighborhood she’s accused previously. None of it makes any sense to my wife or I, not even if we try and bend the rules of logic to try and understand the conspiracy she’s presented us with. We tell her that, based on her telling us that she’s talked with some of these people and they’ve all but confirmed we’re in on this conspiracy, she needs to give us contact info for these people because if they are using our names then we need to have a word with them. She refuses, blows up at us one last time, tells we need to move out, and walks away. 

So, I do the only thing I know to do at that moment, I drive to my aunt and uncle’s house (the aunt and uncle she believes are the brain-trust behind this whole thing). Now, I haven’t talked to my uncle since at least 2010 at the funeral of another uncle of mine, and I haven’t spoken to my aunt since before the pandemic when she sent me a text (not to mention I’d only spoken to her in person once and exchanged maybe 2-3 texts since we had moved into mom’s house). We’ve also specifically avoided this particular aunt and uncle while we lived with mom because of the tension she said existed between them, we didn’t want mom to think we were siding with anyone against her because we genuinely fucking weren’t. 

If they were conspiring with anyone to do anything to mom, I was going to find out (my wife also ended up driving out separately and showed up while we were there). One thing I knew for sure after talking with them, is that they were definitely not part of any conspiracy to steal mom’s shit nor drive her insane. They were blindsided by most of the accusations, but were even more shocked to find that mom had said such hateful things about them to us because she believed that they hated her and were jealous of her. 

I’m still completely floored by all of this, but that day I cried more than I had since my aforementioned uncle passed. My wife and I knew something was definitely wrong with mom, whether it was a highly unlikely conspiracy that made no logical or rational sense and had no evidence to substantiate it, or that something was mentally wrong, it didn’t really matter. We found a place the next day and moved our shit the day after that. We knew it would be a bad idea to stay there any longer with our kids. We have essentially no money and had to borrow enough from my wife’s sister to cover the deposit to move into our new place. We were on a shoestring budget before but now we’re really stretched thin.

We also tried to do as much of the packing and moving as we could without telling mom, but found that to be futile because it was clear (based on text messages she sent us) that she was using the cameras I had installed to watch us. The day after we moved out, she changed the wifi password and had a home security system installed. She has since continued to text either me, my wife, or both of us long rants about her conspiracy. Most of it seems to at least hint that she is not actively accusing us right now of anything, but the shit still doesn’t make any sense and the conspiracy has now grown to include my dad (who doesn’t really have anything to do with my mom any longer), my half-brother (who probably hasn’t spoken to my mom is 30 years), his wife (I’m not even sure if they’ve ever met or spoken to one another), and even the cops because they responded to her home security system going off (probably set off from inside by the dogs) and didn’t catch anyone doing anything. She’s said that she’s found pennies and random bits of wire under some of her windows and that this is apparently an old trick the cops do for…some fucking reason that’s nefarious. 

I don’t know what to believe with respect to my mom any longer. We are now seriously concerned that we’re seeing signs of early onset dementia or a stroke. Concerns that are serious enough that a different aunt of mine (who is a former nurse who’s late husband suffered from Alzheimer’s) has been trying to get mom to talk to her and to at least consider seeing a doctor. But thus far, nothing seems to be working and she just keeps going further down the rabbit hole. You can’t help someone who is convinced they don’t need it.

I’m not even mad anymore, I’m terrified. I’m scared for her. I’m concerned that her illogical and irrational beliefs will turn into illogical and irrational actions. I don’t want to talk to her, not only for my own mental health but because thus far nothing I’ve said to her has done anything but make things worse and send her further into these paranoid delusions. 

I don’t know if my mom is “insane,” but I do know she believes highly illogical and irrational things that have led her to accusing her son and daughter-in-law of trying to actively harm her mentally and financially, in addition to kicking us out along with her own grandchildren during the middle of a pandemic and the fucking holiday season.

We tell her that, based on her telling us that she’s talked with some of these people and they’ve all but confirmed we’re in on this conspiracy, she needs to give us contact info for these people because if they are using our names then we need to have a word with them. She refuses, blows up at us one last time, tells we need to move out, and walks away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I do the only thing I know to do at that moment, I drive to my aunt and uncle’s house (the aunt and uncle she believes are the brain-trust behind this whole thing). Now, I haven’t talked to my uncle since at least 2010 at the funeral of another uncle of mine, and I haven’t spoken to my aunt since before the pandemic when she sent me a text (not to mention I’d only spoken to her in person once and exchanged maybe 2-3 texts since we had moved into mom’s house). We’ve also specifically avoided this particular aunt and uncle while we lived with mom because of the tension she said existed between them, we didn’t want mom to think we were siding with anyone against her because we genuinely fucking weren’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they were conspiring with anyone to do anything to mom, I was going to find out (my wife also ended up driving out separately and showed up while we were there). One thing I knew for sure after talking with them, is that they were definitely not part of any conspiracy to steal mom’s shit nor drive her insane. They were blindsided by most of the accusations, but were even more shocked to find that mom had said such hateful things about them to us because she believed that they hated her and were jealous of her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still completely floored by all of this, but that day I cried more than I had since my aforementioned uncle passed. My wife and I knew something was definitely wrong with mom, whether it was a highly unlikely conspiracy that made no logical or rational sense and had no evidence to substantiate it, or that something was mentally wrong, it didn’t really matter. We found a place the next day and moved our shit the day after that. We knew it would be a bad idea to stay there any longer with our kids. We have essentially no money and had to borrow enough from my wife’s sister to cover the deposit to move into our new place. We were on a shoestring budget before but now we’re really stretched thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also tried to do as much of the packing and moving as we could without telling mom, but found that to be futile because it was clear (based on text messages she sent us) that she was using the cameras I had installed to watch us. The day after we moved out, she changed the wifi password and had a home security system installed. She has since continued to text either me, my wife, or both of us long rants about her conspiracy. Most of it seems to at least hint that she is not actively accusing us right now of anything, but the shit still doesn’t make any sense and the conspiracy has now grown to include my dad (who doesn’t really have anything to do with my mom any longer), my half-brother (who probably hasn’t spoken to my mom is 30 years), his wife (I’m not even sure if they’ve ever met or spoken to one another), and even the cops because they responded to her home security system going off (probably set off from inside by the dogs) and didn’t catch anyone doing anything. She’s said that she’s found pennies and random bits of wire under some of her windows and that this is apparently an old trick the cops do for…some fucking reason that’s nefarious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to believe with respect to my mom any longer. We are now seriously concerned that we’re seeing signs of early onset dementia or a stroke. Concerns that are serious enough that a different aunt of mine (who is a former nurse who’s late husband suffered from Alzheimer’s) has been trying to get mom to talk to her and to at least consider seeing a doctor. But thus far, nothing seems to be working and she just keeps going further down the rabbit hole. You can’t help someone who is convinced they don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not even mad anymore, I’m terrified. I’m scared for her. I’m concerned that her illogical and irrational beliefs will turn into illogical and irrational actions. I don’t want to talk to her, not only for my own mental health but because thus far nothing I’ve said to her has done anything but make things worse and send her further into these paranoid delusions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if my mom is “insane,” but I do know she believes highly illogical and irrational things that have led her to accusing her son and daughter-in-law of trying to actively harm her mentally and financially, in addition to kicking us out along with her own grandchildren during the middle of a pandemic and the fucking holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 has been a shit-show and I already knew the holidays were going to suck, but now it’s a full-on clusterfuck with no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

An hour ago, she woke me up, told me to get up. I said I couldn't, that I'm too tired, so she yelled at me. Said I need to just suck it up, get up, do schoolwork. Said that if I can't even do something as simple as getting up that there must be something seriously wrong with me. And maybe she's right. I feel like I'm so selfish, so lazy, that I'm not actually depressed. Maybe I'm just faking it, using it as an excuse to be lazy and do jack shit. She always says that she's worried about me, and that she'll help me with anything, but if I try to ever explain anything to her she turns it around and talks about herself, never actually listening to what I say. I hate myself for everything I do, yet I'm just to tired to care. I don't even feel like a person anymore.

,depression,"I dont honestly know what to do, there's one thing tying me to this world right now and thats (as lame as it is) my chameleon, Bandit. Hes really wonderful and ive spent every day for a year taking care of him after I got him, we aren't sure how old he is but we think he's at least 3. I recently boarded (kinda like petsitting) him at a store I go to regularly but I got him back and he doesn't look so good.

Im not sure what I'll do if I lose him. I have family and friends, and I know they love me, but the question is, are they worth living for? All of them have hurt me and honestly I forgive them each time but life is just really hard. I know people say that they're worth living for but for some reason the only thing I can think of when I think of living is Bandit, I take care of him and he listens to me (even though he can't hear) but we work on a mutual trust based relationship. I dont disrespect him and his space and in turn he comes to me willingly which is a hard feat for chameleons. 

Its honestly sad that I can't imagine living in a world without a lizard because I know, its just a lizard, but I built a bond with him that I dont have with anyone or anything else. He treats me with the respect that I give him. I dont know what else I can live for if he leaves me

,depression,"I'm a college student and I live alone in an apartment that belongs to my family. I've always struggled with keeping it clean and I guess that very common, but this year it really feels different. Before, I used to clean up at least every 2 weeks, but now I just haven't. I posted this here because I think it has to do with the way I've been feeling, some days I can barely drag myself out of bed. There's also some past trauma that I've been trying to move on from.

I wonder if anyone here has any tips on how to clean my apartment. I just feel like all of this clutter is keeping me in a funky headspace, but at the same time my headspace prevents me from cleaning up the clutter. I've tried starting small, and doing one thing each day, but eventually it all starts feeling so pointless and I go back to where I was before. I've tried making a daily schedule where I plan all the things I want to do, but I end up feeling more and more tired thinking of all the things I wrote and all the times I haven't kept up with said schedule.

I feel like if I just cleaned up I could think more clearly and maybe invite people over, stop being by myself all the time. I also think I would stop feeling so ashamed of myself. But all of this negative thoughts just overwhelm me and stop me from cleaning. 

I also feel the need to clarify that this is a real mess, like theres a gigant mountain of dishes and I don't have a dishwasher so I'd have to wash them by hand. There's also lots of clothes that need to be washed and folded, but I don't have a machine for drying clothes, so they need to be air dried. I also need to clean up the fridge and the stove from head to toe, etc.  What I'm trying to say is that theres no way I could just finish it all in one suddent burst of inspiration.

Does anyone else feel semi-functional whilst at work, but then absolutely collapse in the evenings/on weekends?

I feel like I put on a front at work, and that I either kind of have begun to believe it, or that I am just too stressed/numb to feel the depression in the working-day. Sometimes it’s there as negative thoughts, tiredness, depersonalisation etc, but it’s not nearly as bad as it normally is.

But then, the second I get home and unpack or whatever, I just collapse. I can’t think straight. The depression kicks right back in. It’s there before work too, in the mornings. 

Is this normal? It’s exhausting. I don’t enjoy my work, and I now can’t enjoy my ‘free time’ either. But because I feel functional at work, I feel like I’m faking my ‘part-time’ depression.

Sometimes it’s there as negative thoughts, tiredness, depersonalisation etc, but it’s not nearly as bad as it normally is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, the second I get home and unpack or whatever, I just collapse. I can’t think straight. The depression kicks right back in. It’s there before work too, in the mornings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this normal? It’s exhausting. I don’t enjoy my work, and I now can’t enjoy my ‘free time’ either. But because I feel functional at work, I feel like I’m faking my ‘part-time’ depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, keeping things more casual with people and not expecting anything from anybody makes me feel hollow inside, but at least I won’t get hurt as deeply if they decide to dip out of my life. 

Like, recently I noticed that I don’t have anyone close enough to me in my life that I’d consider a “best friend”, or someone that I trust enough to give my whole heart to. I can only tell around to people that “I’m here to make friends if you want” so many times before I just sound desperate. I *want* someone to *want* my company as a part of their life on the regular so that I feel like maybe I have some sort of purpose. I know now that anyone I care deeply about likely doesn’t care about me in that way. I’ve grown to accept it, as much as it hurts. (I say “grown” like I’m some aged scholar; I’m young; I’m in college).

But when you’re so run down by being by yourself and going through the daily motions of life, you start to feel dull and numbed to everything. People need other people to survive and thrive; as much as I get anxious about socializing with people, it’s better to have someone in my life that I can trust won’t leave me than to have it engrained in my psyche that everyone is purely temporary and that I’m completely forgettable. 

Every friendship I’ve ever been a part of has fizzled out in less than a few years-time. It’s the little things I’m more aware of: hearing from other people less, being left on “read” all the time, less enthusiasm about the prospects of hanging out, keeping conversations short...overthinking at its best. Too often the ball is in their court and it just sits there. I know I shouldn’t expect anything or feel obligated to be responded to, but when it’s almost a pattern, it starts to sting more and more.

Pets are pretty cool though. I’ve had pets my whole life. Maybe I’ll just stick to having cats rather than trying to take opportunities with people like darts and throw them at the wall until something sticks.

Its been 2,5 years of suffering, soon 3, and im tired of getting high on meds to the point of barely being able to walk, only to sleep, then look like a druggie the whole day from being sedated. I hate my symptoms, cant even talk about it

I wanted a girlfriend, to at least make me half happy, but who the fuck needs a wreck like me anyways, and i tried, i posted myself on groups, i searched Fb lists, and i cannot make emotional connection somehow,

But.. only with one person, who already has a boyfriend, so she is my best friend. I tell her how i love her everytime im stoned at 3am...

I cant believe i cant find anyone like that, if she didnt have a boyfriend i would just try and you know.. i told her that its only self control, and how i feel, she understands and said she wouldnt be mad even if i lost control over my emotions

I dont want them to break up, i really dont, i have dirty thoughts but i never try to push them apart, i encourage her to stay with him at her bad times.

But then who will be here with me? I would need physical contact, not sexual, only cuddling and stuff that i never could experience in my life.

I have chronic Lyme, adrenal insufficiency, chronic mononucleosis, candida, disbiosis, anxiety/panic disorder, ocd, depression and ptsd. I dont blame you if you dont believe it

Im tired of it all, i just want.. all i want is to not feel bad physical sensations and to be loved 🥺 people fucking take these for granted, i would trade all my artistic abilities only to get this two things in my life.

I would not call someone a friend who doesn't doesn't care to reach out to me or talk to me to ask me if I am okay, can we hang out or anything so what is even the point.  I do not have nobody because I am hating Georgia so bad but The fact I am lonely on my birthday just because me or my mom is the only ones who will be there but I ain't got no friends makes me feel lonely. I have showed up for people lots of times but nobody wants to show up for me anymore messes with my feelings which causes me to feel like I do. Whether I be nice or being the depressed person ever but mostly when I am happy still people is going to leave but which makes me not want to do anything which is why I hardly ever leave the house. People is going to keep leaving or either unfriending me or blocking when I did nothing wrong or to deserve it will get me to a point I do have a backup messenger account I will end up going off on people who done that to me and say to them so you do not care about me unlike other people you talk to because nobody stays in my life. I feel like I am on a urge of a breakdown  because of doing to things like this happening and if people don't care then I don't care about myself or feel like wanting to do anything is why I sleep all day but just never find the motivation to do anything! I am tired of people playing games with me and if your not going to not talk to me on Facebook but in public please stop because i ain't got time for these twisted mind games! People doesn't know what I go through so I hide what I go through and be happy to see if people will talk to me but still people leave so I am over it! 

Just know I will never get over a person because when I meet new people they are just like them because everyone is the same because everyone leaves because I can't name a person who never will because people add me to block me or ignore the next day when all I ever do is being nice. I know what I got to do let me anger out, punch something or myself because I can't be something that people wants me to be because me being depressed people doesn't want to talk to me so I tried being happy but still nobody does talk to me. I am disabled and I struggle making friends or even opening up to people like in public because I don't speak first because it's too hard to explain like having social anxiety! I do not know if I can have social anxiety if I ain't diagnosed with something because I am too shy to talk to people first or message because I have no idea what to say or get to know people like I want which I was in special ed in school makes me be afraid because I fear of being bullied because I am a quiet person. 
I get left on read when I speak my mind or say anything and nobody gets back to me over years and 2 years now but I won't go chasing nobody even though I get attached easy and become needy because want real friends including people in my life that can be like a sister to me, close friend or brother I can talk to about anything even if it is music but who will never leave or stop talking to me through my darkest times. 
My birthday is Saturday December 5th.

I am going to be lonely especially them are the same friends who left me when I moved away and because I get treated wrong when i moved away from them and Georgia because it seemed they never wanted to talk to me anymore but decided to talk to me when I was in another state talking about they might as well not be my friend unless I came back, starting calling me and my mom names and talking crap about me because my mom had no way to get me so if I go back to the abuse that is why because nobody and like them who I want to come around won't come back around so I am done because I know he won't leave me like everyone else will do and nobody else I can stay with who will help me because I will struggle alone and I can't get a job because they will cut my check because that is what my mom said they will do if I work because I am disabled. So I got nobody else but him and she doesn't care if I go back to him and when I ask her anything she is like she can't help it so I will not bother talking to her about anything if I am such a burden or a terrible person or a waste of space because he is the only way I can move out of state. It will take all i got living on my own because when I pay phone and buy groceries I am broke so i don't make enough living on my own! I lost my friends and I lost everything so he is my only choice as it seems! Nobody understands mental illness and I shut myself out because nobody gets it because the fact I move away I won't be called mean things my stepdad saids about me or get accused of things that is not true about me when I know who I am and the things he saids I do I don't do.

,depression,"Quarantine has been really getting to my head recently. All the joy in my life has been completely sucked away. I was in my last year of middle school and was about to graduate. We were going to go to Washington D.C. for a field trip, which I had been looking forward to my entire middle school career.

I was going to have to say goodbye to everyone. My friends, my teachers who I had gotten so attached to after 3 years. It was going to be sad, but I was ready to move on and excited for the future. Little did I know I was about to get into the worst year of my life.

Once quarantine happened, my friends and I were all excited. We thought virtual school would be fun and it would only be for a month. But that month passed. And another. And another. Graduation was virtual and afterwards my friends sent me a bunch of half hearted goodbye messages.

I’ve been stuck inside for the past 8 months now and by life feels completely meaningless. I feel like my life is actively being taken from me. All these memories and good times I was supposed to have have been taken away and I’m worried I’ll have tons of regrets about the things I didn’t get to experience when I’m older.

I’m stuck in the same loop everyday. I go to school on the computer and then spend the rest of my day on my phone. I feel like a complete failure and I’m reminded everyday when I look at myself in the mirror.

I’m in high school now and I don’t know anybody. We don’t really get a chance to talk to each other because the teachers always telling us to shut up. I have no one to talk to and I try reaching out to my friends but they’re too busy with THEIR school to reach out. 

Whenever we do talk, things are really forced and things don’t flow as naturally as they used to. I feel like I almost don’t know them anymore.

 My parents asked me yesterday if I was feeling okay. They’ve been really stressed out with financial troubles because my dads company is going through hard times. I don’t want to worry then anymore so I just fake a smile and say that I’m doing great while I try not to let the sadness overtake me.

Anyway, that’s just how I’ve been feeling recently. I know posting this on Reddit is a weird thing to do but I just need to get all this out of my system.

And actually going to school was a nightmare! I would put on this fake face of ""I don't give a crap"" or a ""comedic"" face, but in reality, I felt like every single move I made was being judged for some reason. Even walking incorrectly was a worry. It even transfered over to college. In more recent years I started heavily questioning my own life. ""I'm too afraid of doing something wrong to get a job"" or ""why would anyone watch my videos, there are so many creators better than me"". I would always compare myself to others, and I heavily debated taking my own life for being a useless slob. I even wrote a will. One night, I couldn't take it anymore, and I texted my best friend and asked if he was open to talk the next day. I had never told anyone these things before so this was a big step for me. We've been best friends since kindergarten. We've got more memories than either of us can count. I went to his college campus, and told him the huge history of what made me depressed and why school was so terrible. To his credit, he was a very good listener. He even shared some of his school dilemmas. Apparently, he was bullied/disliked for being my friend. Everyone but him would be invited to events for the basketball team. The fact that he continued being my friend regardless of these things made me cry on the inside. It showed me that people can put on very convincing faces. I finally got to the part of wanting to kill myself. After my story was over, he started talking to me about whether I was saved or not. Now, I'm in a Christian family, and we both attended a private school. I've heard these things hundreds of times. I've become numb to it all. This didn't upset me or anything, since I knew he was just trying to help, but then he made a suggestion.
 ""Did you tell your parents?"" 
Now, I know my parents. I also know exactly how they would react if I told them that I was depressed or had constant anxiety. Without going into details, it would NOT help the problem. Telling my parents might even make it worse, depending. So I responded ""no"" to my friend. I know normally, telling your parents would probably be a good thing, but not in my case. I was more confident in my own abilities to get better without my parents getting in on it. After this, we went our separate ways. It actually helped to share my problem with him, i was surprised. A week later I went to visit him again. This time it didn't have anything to do with my mental state, I just wanted to hang out. Once it was almost time to head out, he asked me about how I was doing. I responded by telling him about how talking really helped. Then he asked it again.
""Did you tell your parents?""
I answered the same say i did the week before. ""It wouldn't help, i know how they'll react""
He wasn't having it. He suggested again that I tell them.
I said no.
He said it again.
I said no.
This happened several times, each time getting more intense than the last. He finally pulled his phone out and threatened to call my mom. I tried convincing him that it will only make things worse, but he wasn't having it. I was half tempted to grab the phone out of his hand and delete the contact info. But I knew he could just get it back if I did. 
He hit the ""Call"" button. When my mom answered, he didn't actually tell her anything, but he basically told her that I have a big problem to talk to her about. I told my mom that I'd call her later on my own phone and hung up. The last thing I told my friend was that he made a big mistake, and to not be surprised to not hear from me for a while. I managed to squirm out of having to tell my parents about it, but the next few weeks were miserable. I was so afraid of them figuring it out, and they were getting close, but they never did. Fast forward to present day(two months later), and I have gotten out of my depression and anxiety mindset. I basically forced it out of myself, if that makes sense. I made a consistent diet, started exercising, judging myself less, and comparing myself to others far less. I'm not 100%, but I feel better than I ever have. My mindset was: ""If I don't have the problem, then my parents won't ever figure it out."" But now I have a new problem. What do I do about my friend? On the one hand, he shouldn't have tried to force a solution to MY problem. But on the other hand, he sort of indirectly helped by attempting to tell my parents. I don't want to never see him again or something. But at the same time, what if he's not convinced and tries to tell them AGAIN, but directly this time. I'm conflicted and I welcome any ideas/advice. I don't know how to confront my best friend again.

I ended up getting a BA and MA in political science and with the exception of my 4th year which was pretty ok. I've been unemployed and I don't like my options in life. I had a decent social life due to beer league soccer and softball but COVID has put a stop to that.

I wanted to work in the civil service or as a cop but I didn't find out until after graduating that both are extremely competitive and I probably won't get hired. My degrees aren't very practical and I just don't want to try anymore in life. I've trying for years and I haven't gotten very far and now I've just been in a slump for a year. 

I'm not interested in retraining but I'm not even interested in applying for jobs anymore

My therapist isn't very helpful or understanding and I'm not interested or willing in taking anti-depressants. TBH I might have ADHD but my GP is a pain to deal with on this stuff.

,depression,"For some reason, I care about some things and don't care for other things. What I mean is what I value has completely changed.

Sometimes, I keep thinking about my appearance and whether I get along with others.

But I don't care for my future. I don't care about school or college.

I feel that maybe the reason why I care about my appearance and my social skills is because all I care about is being accepted and cared for. I want people to like me. I want people to be affectionate with me and tell me I mean something when I can't help feeling worthless.

I don't know why. It's like I have given up on my future. I can't really think about what the future will be like. I can't really envision my future. I don't care for goals such as getting good grades in school and getting into a good college. I just don't care. I would be fine ending my life before having to deal with greater responsibilities, but it's really difficult to succeed with that. But I know at the same time, as a high schooler, I should make sure I can achieve those (doing properly in school/college), so I can be financially independent and be able to support myself.

But I don't know why goals like that are not connected to my self-esteem but more on purpose. I don't know how to get myself to care. You could say that discipline is only important, but I need to make sure I have a good perspective. We all do certain things because it means something to us, but the thing is I don't care if I do bad in school.

You could say I'm blaming depression. Um, I wasn't like this in the past. I worked hard in school. That was 7 months ago. I was the type of person who would get As. Now, I'm putting minimal effort. I'm just wondering how can I change my mindset. I'm sorry, I know I come across as shallow and attention-seeking and someone who does not care for long-term goals.

By appearance, I mean I'm trying to eat healthy and exercise. By social skills, I want to read more to become interesting. This is ideal tho. Everything's been on and off. It's hard dealing with classes while also dealing with after-school things (taekwondo, tutoring class). Like one week, I try hard on things like being healthy and reading. The next week, I rush on work. I'm not good at managing my time.

I understand discipline is important, but I would like to know if there's a way I can change my mindset. You can definitely call me out in the comments for how I'm being wrong.

I know it's not as bad as others, but I would appreciate advice.

**The reason why I find it hard for me is I was already a procrastinator in the past when I was not depressed.** When I was not depressed, I would use my time after-school reading webtoons honestly, and only at like 9-11 pm, I actually started doing work. But I worked hard. Now, I think things are harder. I'm not using my time on hobbies though. I mainly doing nothing all day - hearing music and overthinking things. I try to get work done, but I feel really down (not neutral) that it's hard to pay attention to work. I feel I need to always keep my headphones on to keep my mood elevated, but I end up paying attention to the music too much. Some days, I cry a lot and I think it gets hard to go back to doing work because I feel really tired. I also have headaches pretty much all the time, and pain medication does not help.

You see, I was the kid who worked hard in school, but I was very lonely. I worked hard because I had a plan, and I had hope that maybe I can be successful in the future. Then, it hit me that I had trouble improving on my SAT and in junior year, I was trying harder than the previous years, and I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. I wasn't doing bad, but I was feeling resentful. It also hit me that maybe my social skills will never get better. So, I should stop thinking that I can postpone things and just focus on studies. I don't have leadership skills or public speaking skills, so I found it hard to get leadership positions in extracurriculars. I also had the realization that I'm below average, so I care more about my appearance. I always felt insecure about it, and I felt I always gave people bad first impressions. I really want to get along with people, and I feel maybe lookism had something to do with why I was having trouble.

I feel that with me in the past, because I had goals, I could do the work because I would feel good that I'd be doing well in school and if I told myself that I would do bad if I don't work on this now, I would work hard because I wouldn't want that to happen. It was like maybe a carrot-stick system. The thing is I cared and I had a plan set out for my future.

I was morbidly abused by them as a child (if you want the details you can look at my profile), and although I'm not being abused now, the environment is just as toxic.

My mom loves to defend him as if he isn't the same man that told us that he wouldn't have kids again if he could.

My mom and dad have made a bunch of morally &amp; financially illiterate decisions that have caused an impending eviction crisis for the family (my dad going to jail for medicare/medicaid fraud, my mom being negligent of the property tax, etc), so I'll probably have to find a place soon anyway.

I had a friend offer me his place but he ended up ghosting me. I had another friend offer her place but her boyfriend had a problem with it.

I was morbidly abused by them as a child (if you want the details you can look at my profile), and although I&amp;#39;m not being abused now, the environment is just as toxic. My dad loves to hear himself preach egregiously incorrect racist rhetoric and tries to tell me what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong with my life with an arrogant tone as if he&amp;#39;s the modern day Aristotle. My mom loves to defend him as if he isn&amp;#39;t the same man that told us that he wouldn&amp;#39;t have kids again if he could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom and dad have made a bunch of morally &amp;amp; financially illiterate decisions that have caused an impending eviction crisis for the family (my dad going to jail for medicare/medicaid fraud, my mom being negligent of the property tax, etc), so I&amp;#39;ll probably have to find a place soon anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a friend offer me his place but he ended up ghosting me. I had another friend offer her place but her boyfriend had a problem with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of money saved up so I&amp;#39;ve been heavily considering getting my own place, but I&amp;#39;ve been told that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be fiscally sound to do so without a job, so I decided to sacrifice my sanity and save money for the time being.

i can't bitch about it to her because from her perspective, it's her fault, and that will only make her more upset.

i can't bitch about it to anyone else because they don't get it either. all i can do is bury my feelings and hope my subconscious will process them into something less unbearable.

,depression,"Hi. There is more than 2 years now since I’ve lost my self esteem, I am not confident anymore, I don’t think about myself as being a beautiful woman anymore and I have the feeling that every other woman is more beautiful than I am.

The context: I am crazy in love with my actual bf and everything started the first time we met. At that time, he used to fuck a lot of girls and he was obsessed about his ex who left him and still in love with her. For 1 and half years, he was having sex with me and other 4 girls (he told me- I was so stupid back then thinking that I have to appreciate his honesty and He will be mine if I accept that. Then, after that period, we started to be in a relationship (he got tired of chasing his ex and the other girls were not available anymore. 
Everything was ok, but I developed a jealousy I could not control anymore and started to dig into that period again...I read his messages and found out what he was saying about me: that I am not as beautiful as his ex or that he was thinking about other girls when having sex with me.

There is more than 2 years now since I’ve lost my self esteem, I am not confident anymore, I don’t think about myself as being a beautiful woman anymore and I have the feeling that every other woman is more beautiful than I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context: I am crazy in love with my actual bf and everything started the first time we met. At that time, he used to fuck a lot of girls and he was obsessed about his ex who left him and still in love with her. For 1 and half years, he was having sex with me and other 4 girls (he told me- I was so stupid back then thinking that I have to appreciate his honesty and He will be mine if I accept that. Then, after that period, we started to be in a relationship (he got tired of chasing his ex and the other girls were not available anymore. 
Everything was ok, but I developed a jealousy I could not control anymore and started to dig into that period again...I read his messages and found out what he was saying about me: that I am not as beautiful as his ex or that he was thinking about other girls when having sex with me. And he uSed to male fun of my texts with his friends.

Humans are vermin and anything you can do to earn their love is disgusting.

I hope something happens in the future to make your friends regret making you cut yourself into pieces for them.

No human (a) can love another human (b) unless (b) violently disfigures themselves and limits their own potential in order to fit what (a) wants.

If you have anyone who loves you, know that you are (b) and you are an incomplete person.

And for that, I die.

&amp;#x200B;

You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone you think loves you? Your relationship with them is mutually abusive.

&amp;#x200B;

You are stabbing each other.

You are goading each other into violently disfiguring yourselves in order to match.

&amp;#x200B;

Because that is the only way humans can communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

By cutting each other down.

&amp;#x200B;

And I refuse to let people cut me down.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's why I'm alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to listen to people who tell me to stop being myself, stop thinking, stop having my own opinions, stop having my own tastes. My tastes don't conform, therefore they're not ""relevant"", and I should be ashamed. My tastes are positive and non-violent, therefore they're ""sugarcoated"" and inferior and I should be ashamed. My opinions don't conform to Side A or Side B, therefore I must be the bad guy -- both A and B think I'm the bad guy because I think for myself instead of just repeating after them. I don't retweet. I think. 

Therefore, I can never be heard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot cut off my humanity and my dignity to fit you, to please you. 

So I won't.

And yes, I do resent the rest of you for cutting yourselves down to get along with each other. And there's no reason why I shouldn't. You should be resented, because what you are doing is wrong. What your parents and teachers did to you when you were small, beating the curiosity out of you, was wrong. It's happened to the whole species for millennia, that's how we get the societies we have. And it's wrong, and I refuse to accept it. 

I refuse to accept the ignorance that humans must conform to in order to be allowed to live in society.

And I do resent the rest of you who do assent to it.",,False,,0,False,Humans are vermin,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k37ce4,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,,,False,,,{},,True,,1606674844.0,text,0,,,,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are vermin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are vermin, they are too shallow to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are vermin and anything you can do to earn their love is disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you kept the limbs you cut off to make friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the stench of your own rotting flesh keeps you up at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope something happens in the future to make your friends regret making you cut yourself into pieces for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are too shallow for love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No human (a) can love another human (b) unless (b) violently disfigures themselves and limits their own potential in order to fit what (a) wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have anyone who loves you, know that you are (b) and you are an incomplete person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, the unloved, am the only complete one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I refuse to sacrifice my dignity for you vermin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to feel like garbage because you want me to be like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to stop thinking just because you can&amp;#39;t handle the things I think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I refuse to let you own me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for that, I die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a year, I will be beaten and thrown in prison for refusing to conform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is just what humanity is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have no regrets and I can not do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a moment of happiness in your life, ever, know that you are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, yes, you. You are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are an abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone you think loves you? Your relationship with them is mutually abusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are stabbing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So I have a bit long of a background story I would like to share:

When I was very little (about 5) I had an asthma problem and made it hard for me to breathe. I had asthma attacks. I eventually had my tonsils and adenoids removed from surgery. And then I was put on an inhaler medication. But it had some nasty side effects, so I was switched to another one. This happened a few times until I was put onto 'Q-var.' That one had the least side effects and I eventually was tapered off the medication at about 8.

Now, many years later (I am a teenager BTW,) COVID-19 comes around and the new school year is starting up soon. My school is offering online learning and in person learning. I really want to do in person learning because the online thing sucked before. So since I was 8, I never had problems with asthma ever. But because I have viral-induced asthma, my mom wanted me to get checked at the asthma place before they choose in person learning just in case.

So we get the tests done and find out that my lung function is actually at 80%, and I have to do the online learning thing. I was really disappointed because online learning sucks (in my opinion). The school year started and my and my two younger sisters began online learning. But something was not right - my littlest sister was not doing good in online learning. She is in 4th grade and it wasn't going well at all. The teacher kept making mistakes, and she was learning almost nothing.

That's not all though. I had to get back onto the Q-var medication until my lung function went up. And in the meantime that my parents were trying to find a way for my youngest sister to learn something during the online school, I began to notice some weird side effects from the medication. I felt chest pressure and a rapid heart rate more and more often. It always happened about 1-2 hours after I took the medication. I took one dose in the morning and one in the evening.

It began developing into health anxiety (hypochondria). I didn't know if it was really side effects, even though I was reassured all the time. I thought maybe I had a problem with my heart or lungs. I was constantly checking myself for symptoms, and it became a daily habit. And then we had an idea, to talk to my asthma doctor about it. So we went back there to talk to him.

He put me on a new med, 'Flo-Vent,"" and my mom asked him if my littlest sister could go back to in-person school because the online thing wasn't working for her. He said that was ok. So she went back to school, and my other little sister then wanted to go back too. So she eventually went back, and I was the only one stuck with online learning. I got another test and my lungs were fine, getting better with the meds. I was assured there was nothing wrong.

Little by little, mild depression creeped up on me during online learning. I barely ever got to see my friends for real, and I am a very social person. And the health anxiety was back too. ""What if there is something misdiagnosed? What if it is a heart problem and not a lung thing?"" But my new med had no showing side effects of chest pain yet.

More and more, I started getting a feeling of light-headedness and dizziness. I would be walking around and just feel light headed for no reason, particularly after standing up. So I got worried all over again, and we went to see my regular health provider.

I was diagnosed with 'Orthostatic Hypotension,"" very similar to 'POTS."" I did a test where I lied down, sat up, and stood up. I was told to drink 6-8 bottles of water a day and increase salt in my diet. After that I did ok with the water but always forgot to increase salt. I still continued feeling light-headed and a little dizzy.

I continued online school and my depression got worse. Also my health anxiety was getting pretty bad and those combined made me feel pretty horrible most of the time. This is about the time when the brain fog started. It started mild, and got worse over time. Sometimes it came and went. At the time I didn't know what it was called, all I knew was that I had some trouble recalling memories, concentrating on things, etc. It got pretty bad so I took another trip to my healthcare provider.

Once there I knew it was called brain fog, and I was reassured that I was fine. I got prescribed with an anxiety medication. On the way home though, I was feeling optimistic at the time. (Sometimes I felt optimistic about my anxiety, depression, and brain fog, sometimes I just felt doomed.) I decided I could try to take on the anxiety without the medication because I didn't want to be the 1% of people who got the side effect of the medication, which is suicidal thoughts. I didn't want to even take the risk of that.

I used to love my life. I was happy, energetic, always doing stuff, but now I always felt down, and I didn't find as much interest in the things I did anymore. I felt like I was becoming a different person. Later on, I began looking up brain fog and found out that it could be a symptom of a stroke or seizure or something, and got extremely worried. Then I began looking out for signs of a stroke.

One morning, I went to rowing (I row as my sport for now) and I was feeling sick to my stomach, and the brain fog was getting so bad I could barely pay attention to what was happening. I threw up in the bathroom and called my mom to come pick me up. It was once I was already in the car that I realized that I was having a really bad panic attack. But the brain fog got extreme during the panic attack, and I  was thinking I might have had a stroke or something. I got really freaked out.

Later on in the day I felt ok. But I was still very scared. The brain fog continued on. My parents decided I should go back to in person learning, and I was so happy. I thought maybe I would be ok, and there is nothing wrong with me. This was when my parents got divorced.

I can't get into all the details, but it was very stressful and caused a lot of arguments. I cried until my eyes were dry and I was so sad and depressed that day. I felt like my life really was ruined and I would never be happy again. The brain fog increased over time after this happened. It got really annoying sometimes. I talked to a counselor which helped a little but I still felt terrible.

I got terrible depression. I never wanted this to happen and it was so unexpected and so scary. Now I had to go to two houses and it felt so weird and everything was so uncomfortable. The brain fog peaked, and I had this weird feeling inside me like nothing is the same anymore. I just want to feel normal again.

Now, the brain fog has started going down. But not all the way. Instead of having problems with concentration, it became mostly memory based, and mostly disorientation. It's nearly impossible to describe, but the best I could say would be: ""Where should I be? What should I be feeling?"" It's like I feel like I don't know where I am but I know where I am. It's really stressful not being able to describe it perfectly but I just want it to go away.

That's where I am now. Just brain fog, extreme depression, and I just want to feel normal again. My health anxiety has mostly gone away and for the most part I can accept my feelings and thoughts are because of anxiety/depression, but I still have lasting effects of hypochondria (like constantly checking myself for symptoms, etc.) I still get worried a lot that I might have a brain problem but most of the time evidence points to anxiety/depression/stress.

One more thing: A disorder called 'Derealization disorder' I found one time seems exactly what I have. I'll copy and paste what it says here:

Derealization symptoms include

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling detached from their surroundings (eg, people, objects, everything), which seem unreal

Patients may feel as if they are in a dream or a fog or as if a glass wall or veil separates them from their surroundings. The world seems lifeless, colorless, or artificial. Subjective distortion of the world is common. For example, objects may appear blurry or unusually clear; they may seem flat or smaller or larger than they are. Sounds may seem louder or softer than they are; time may seem to be going too slow or too fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms are almost always distressing and, when severe, profoundly intolerable. Anxiety and depression are common. Some patients fear that they have irreversible brain damage or that they are going crazy. Others obsess about whether they really exist or repeatedly check to determine whether their perceptions are real. However, patients always retain the knowledge that their unreal experiences are not real but rather are just the way that they feel (ie, they have intact reality testing). This awareness differentiates depersonalization/derealization disorder from a psychotic disorder, in which such insight is always lacking.

That's it. Everything it says there can EXACTLY describe how I feel most of the time. (Along with many other feelings, of course.) I just feel so overwhelmed all the time, lightheaded, dizzy, nervous, sad, angry, depressed, confused, brain foggy, and just overall weird. I need some help and I wonder if anyone has ideas.

,depression,"Gosh, I feel so selfish posting such a self-centered post but, let's get to my point. I will not be making a TL;DR because this needs a lot of contexts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few facts about myself, I was homeschooled, was for all 12 years. I have 5 siblings and we all were homeschooled in a decent size home, this is relevant. I am now 17 (18 in one day) and I have graduated from high school.

&amp;#x200B;

My story &amp; the problem:

&amp;#x200B;

As I've stated before I've been homeschooled my whole life. Christian curriculum. I appreciate my mom homeschooling us and putting in so much work but I feel lost. I feel like I cannot relate with anyone so I have nothing to talk about. I am an 'introvert' if you will, all of my siblings are. Whenever a person talks to me rather than actually talking to them I think of ways to get out of the conversation as fast as possible while pretending I am actually interested in the conversation. I have also always felt old. I never felt like I was a teenager, I don't know if it's because I was homeschooled and raised in Christianity my whole life but even when I was 15-16 I felt old and had no feelings for girls my age. I felt like if I were to date them it would be weird as I am much older than them even though I am not. Again, I am almost 18 but I would never date anyone 16/17 just no. feels creepy. I have always been overweight for as long as I could remember, and I have been trying to lose it since 12 years old and I feel like this plays a part in a much bigger picture.

During my 'tweenage' years I was becoming what most would call an 'sjw' I was super sensitive and emotional and I hated any form of hate, bullying, racism, etc, and would always play 'good guy' in any scenario. I was always looking for a reason to help someone to better their day and this was driven by my taste to be a benefit to someone. I feel like this is no more and instead, I am doing it because I feel like it's more of duty rather than what I want to do. I do not trust anyone outside of my family because during these tweenage years I had some online friends that always seemed to backstab, betray, or have some ulterior motive for being my friend.

I have always wanted to be a police officer for as long as I can remember. I have always told myself it's because I want to help people and the very thought of someone being tortured with nobody to help them absolutely infuriates me. But, that has changed in the past 2 years. I question why I want to be a cop, I feel like now it's just a 'calling' I feel like I lack emotion and sympathy and my morals are all screwed up. I find enjoyment in watching bugs get tortured in fact, when I was around 14 I would get bugs and cut them up with scissors, or set them on fire and I would get mentally excited at watching them roll around in agony. While doing this, I like to imagine them screaming. I feel no remorse or anything. I once had a pet mantis (about 5 months ago) it was old and struggling to even walk so I decided to put it down. I cut off its head and I felt so satisfied when I did it. I will not move to animals though, just bugs. Seeing gore, bugs, or movies/books of people being tortured/mutilated, etc sometimes gets me sexually aroused and I feel like a freak show.

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, I feel like I am a friendly guy and I would never go out my way to harm any person. I can honestly say I have never in my entire life intentionally with malicious intentions bullied anyone. In fact, when I was 14, I made an 'anti-suicide' discord and I have messaged people trying to help or cure them of depression. I still want to be a cop or ems to help people but again, I feel little to no emotion being my actions. I feel so lost with who I am and I feel like a failure as I've not only failed to lose weight, but I keep giving in to these crazy urges and doing ungodly things. I am often times depressed and I lack self-motivation to do anything besides what I absolutely MUST do. I have had a job for a while though and I am probably going to go to college this February.

I question why I want to be a cop, I feel like now it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;#39;calling&amp;#39; I feel like I lack emotion and sympathy and my morals are all screwed up. I find enjoyment in watching bugs get tortured in fact, when I was around 14 I would get bugs and cut them up with scissors, or set them on fire and I would get mentally excited at watching them roll around in agony. While doing this, I like to imagine them screaming. I feel no remorse or anything. I once had a pet mantis (about 5 months ago) it was old and struggling to even walk so I decided to put it down. I cut off its head and I felt so satisfied when I did it. I will not move to animals though, just bugs. Seeing gore, bugs, or movies/books of people being tortured/mutilated, etc sometimes gets me sexually aroused and I feel like a freak show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I feel like I am a friendly guy and I would never go out my way to harm any person. I can honestly say I have never in my entire life intentionally with malicious intentions bullied anyone. In fact, when I was 14, I made an &amp;#39;anti-suicide&amp;#39; discord and I have messaged people trying to help or cure them of depression. I still want to be a cop or ems to help people but again, I feel little to no emotion being my actions. I feel so lost with who I am and I feel like a failure as I&amp;#39;ve not only failed to lose weight, but I keep giving in to these crazy urges and doing ungodly things. I am often times depressed and I lack self-motivation to do anything besides what I absolutely MUST do. I have had a job for a while though and I am probably going to go to college this February. What in God&amp;#39;s name is wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

TW: Suicide, Self-hate, Eating disorder 

I've struggled with depression since I was about 14. I didn't like myself before then too, but atleast I had childhood innocence and the world seemed brighter and I felt like there were more possibilities.

Things didn't really pan out. Its my fault. I'm unhappy because of me.

I'm 22 now. I feel like my entire life has been a waste. I used to be able to make friends. Now not so much. My only friends are from when I was in school. I'm lucky. I know most friendships from when you're young don't last but truthfully I feel as if things are finally winding down in that department. They have their own lives. They love me and I love them but life moves on. I haven't made a new friend since highschool. I feel like my social prowess has atrophied.

The one thing that kept me going was music. I loved it so much. I used to lay awake in bed and listen to albums and just feel this euphoria. I play guitar. I write music. For the longest time I wanted to seriously pursue one of my bands or a career in music/audio production but things didn't go that way. My depression got so crippling I didn't even want to arrange band practices. I've written so much material and yet not even a single actual release because I don't have the drive or commitment to record my music. And the worst part? I'm becoming numb to it. I haven't written in months. I used to feel this ache in my belly to write and play and record and now its nothing. I used to eagerly await and even review new releases and now I don't listen to music even a tenth of the amount I used to.

I'm ugly and overweight. I've struggled with trying to become healthier and coping with an eating disorder. It didn't use to be as bad but from the time I went into college I've gained over 100 pounds leaving me now at the heaviest I've ever been. And now I can feel it starting to take its toll on my body. I know in a few years, less if the weight gain increases, my knees and back will start to hurt and a myriad of other negative drawbacks. 

Its my fault. I've lost lots of weight but relapse. The truth is... I feel like I don't deserve to lose it. I don't deserve to move on from any of the bad things I have going on. If I did, I would've done something about it by now. I suppose in a way it was denial. That hopefulness that I'd lose weight, and record an EP, and go out and meet new people and date and have fun experiences... it was all just denial.

The last few months have been bad. Part of that is Covid. I used to go to class and atleast distract myself with that but now I just lay in bed for hours and cry. I've lost about 15 pounds in the last few weeks due to diet alone which is good but I feel like I'm about to relapse again. 

And don't even get me started on intimacy. I was luckily never seduced into Nice Guy and Incel rhetoric. I never blamed anyone else for my romantic failings. I don't blame women for not wanting me. I used to try. Used to ask people out, go out and meet people, online dating etc. but it never worked. The rejection hurt but in time it too became numb.

Like any regular guy I watch porn and masturbate. Not an unhealthy amount. I used to have a really high sex drive but it has waned as well. When I think of myself with someone else. Someone touching me or taking of my clothes... I feel like crying. It scares me. Physical intimacy scares me. I feel like if ever someone actually wanted to be with me I'd just be inadequate and disappoint.

My future for now seems to be finishing my bachelor's degree and finding a job so I can eventually move to some shitty apartment far away so my family and friends don't have to watch me deteriorate. If I make it to then.

I think about suicide alot. Every day since I was 14. I've only seriously considered it a few times when things got really bleak. I don't think I'd want to kill myself atleast not until my parents pass which will hopefully be in a long long time. 

I'm not sure what will happen. When I was little I wanted to do and be so much. Apart from my job and creative endeavors I wanted a family. A wife and kids to settle down with and raise. Now... I don't think I'm good enough. Not for a one night stand let alone for marriage. I don't think I'd be a good dad. I resent my father but in a lot of ways I'm becoming like him.

I know we're supposed to value and love ourselves. The truth is it feels like I'm lying to myself. Denial again. Denial in thinking that things will be better and denial in thinking that I'm worth something. 

At this point I don't have anything to offer pretty much anyone. I think I'll eventually die and it will hopefully be alone and no one will get hurt.

I'll keep trying. I don't think I've lost hope. I've just accepted that in all likelihood I'll fail again, like I always have.

For the longest time I wanted to seriously pursue one of my bands or a career in music/audio production but things didn&amp;#39;t go that way. My depression got so crippling I didn&amp;#39;t even want to arrange band practices. I&amp;#39;ve written so much material and yet not even a single actual release because I don&amp;#39;t have the drive or commitment to record my music. And the worst part? I&amp;#39;m becoming numb to it. I haven&amp;#39;t written in months. I used to feel this ache in my belly to write and play and record and now its nothing. I used to eagerly await and even review new releases and now I don&amp;#39;t listen to music even a tenth of the amount I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m ugly and overweight. I&amp;#39;ve struggled with trying to become healthier and coping with an eating disorder. It didn&amp;#39;t use to be as bad but from the time I went into college I&amp;#39;ve gained over 100 pounds leaving me now at the heaviest I&amp;#39;ve ever been. And now I can feel it starting to take its toll on my body. I know in a few years, less if the weight gain increases, my knees and back will start to hurt and a myriad of other negative drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its my fault. I&amp;#39;ve lost lots of weight but relapse. The truth is... I feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve to lose it. I don&amp;#39;t deserve to move on from any of the bad things I have going on. If I did, I would&amp;#39;ve done something about it by now. I suppose in a way it was denial. That hopefulness that I&amp;#39;d lose weight, and record an EP, and go out and meet new people and date and have fun experiences... it was all just denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been bad. Part of that is Covid. I used to go to class and atleast distract myself with that but now I just lay in bed for hours and cry. I&amp;#39;ve lost about 15 pounds in the last few weeks due to diet alone which is good but I feel like I&amp;#39;m about to relapse again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t even get me started on intimacy. I was luckily never seduced into Nice Guy and Incel rhetoric. I never blamed anyone else for my romantic failings. I don&amp;#39;t blame women for not wanting me. I used to try. Used to ask people out, go out and meet people, online dating etc. but it never worked. The rejection hurt but in time it too became numb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any regular guy I watch porn and masturbate. Not an unhealthy amount. I used to have a really high sex drive but it has waned as well. When I think of myself with someone else. Someone touching me or taking of my clothes... I feel like crying. It scares me. Physical intimacy scares me. I feel like if ever someone actually wanted to be with me I&amp;#39;d just be inadequate and disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My future for now seems to be finishing my bachelor&amp;#39;s degree and finding a job so I can eventually move to some shitty apartment far away so my family and friends don&amp;#39;t have to watch me deteriorate. If I make it to then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about suicide alot. Every day since I was 14. I&amp;#39;ve only seriously considered it a few times when things got really bleak. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d want to kill myself atleast not until my parents pass which will hopefully be in a long long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what will happen. When I was little I wanted to do and be so much. Apart from my job and creative endeavors I wanted a family. A wife and kids to settle down with and raise. Now... I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m good enough. Not for a one night stand let alone for marriage. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be a good dad. I resent my father but in a lot of ways I&amp;#39;m becoming like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know we&amp;#39;re supposed to value and love ourselves. The truth is it feels like I&amp;#39;m lying to myself. Denial again. Denial in thinking that things will be better and denial in thinking that I&amp;#39;m worth something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I don&amp;#39;t have anything to offer pretty much anyone. I think I&amp;#39;ll eventually die and it will hopefully be alone and no one will get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll keep trying. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve lost hope. I&amp;#39;ve just accepted that in all likelihood I&amp;#39;ll fail again, like I always have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this, thank you. I hope no one feels this way.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," Dear guys and girls, dear sufferers, dear survivers,

I'm suffering from **depression and social anxiety** since I was 15 years old (now 21). My **symptoms** are painful negative thoughts about past, present and future starting right in the morning when I open my eyes. Otherwise: huge lack of drive/motivation, anhedonia (lack of interests, almost nothing that stimulates me), lethargy, feelings of extremely painful inner emptiness and restlessness (hard to explain but somehow as being alive in a dead body or being buried alive without being able to do anything against it), cognitive decline (focus, memory, access to thoughts) body pain (makes it hard to stand, sit straight, walk, keeping body posture and walk stairs), typical symptoms of social anxiety etc.

**Medication**: I tried 10 different medications until now. 8 antidepressant, 2 neuroleptics: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix) and Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine. None worked, none gave me any effect at all except for side effects, sexual ones etc.

**Conversational Therapy**: I had 2 depth psychological therapies. No success. Right now I'm in a behavorial therapy. The therapist is quite good but I never have much to add or feelings of new enlightenments. Makes me think my depression is mainly biological/neurological. Could be.

I discovered **alcohol** in the age of 15, a substance that improves mood just by drinking some liquid, damn, a wow! effect. With 17 I started drinking daily, first only in the evenings to kill negative thoughts, be able to enjoy life and sleep. With the time I began drinking in the mornings and before events especially social ones but somehow for everything: sports, seeing natives, seeing friends, before school, then before university and so on. Imagine being drunk everywhere, sitting buzzed out in school, in lectures of university, playing tennis drunk, sitting drunk at the table with your mother and brother without anyone else knowing you're drunk. I drank almost everything, beer, wine but mainly hard stuff like vodka for the odor. And I still don't know why but no one ever noticed anything about me being buzzed to drunk all day. I had trained my techniques, drinking vodka, then eating garlic, gum, just putting anything with strong odor for example sauces in my mouth burbling and consuming it. Then a hot shower with a lot of shampoo and brushing my teeth with a lot of toothpaste. Now I was ready for the day, dumbed and buzzed out but therefor less negative thoughts and more good mood and ability to talk, socialize and be funny. Alcohol seemed like a godsend for me, it was my antidepressant and anxiolytic. What a dumb therapy, I didn't think about it in the beginning, some day I recognized how dumb it was but I didn't care as everything, every addiction, every physiological damage I was doing myself, was better than feeling the psychological pain I would experience being sober. I drank mostly daily until I was 19, then I lost my driving licencse because of course drinking that often alcohol was almost always in my blood. It was late night, the morning after I directly quit cold turkey and never began drinking alcohol since ever. Nowadays I can't even drink alcohol anymore, I tried as society (friends, family, just social events) kind of forces one to, BUT I can't enjoy it, it just directly gives me headache, (strangely for alcohol but) bad mood, tiredness and very psychological and physiological unpleasantness in general. This occurs right after one or two sips. Kind of sad, I think sometimes, but probably the best thing for me and my health.

With 20 I discovered **phenibut**, oh yeah. First I was sticking to the very important rule only consuming it twice a week. Then as I went back to university I couldn't stand not being able to socialize again, I wanted to talk to people, make friends, meet girls, be able to impress people and not be branded as the shy, silent, not interesting at all boy in university. It was not only about impressing them but also myself as being this psychologically disabled boy made me very depressive and sad. Another thing was my disabled cognition due to depression. Before phenibut I sat in universiy and didn't understand a thing, I was socially anxious and panicful all the time. I spent much more attention to what this person 3 rows in front of me thinks about me, what the girl sitting 6 rows behind me would think about how I sat, when I would cough or give a strange sound from me. Thanks to phenibut I didn't care, I could focus on the topics, not on the people around me and what they could think about me (even if they don't care anyways, it was very paranoid and irrational thinking). I had the greatest idea, creativity and funny jokes on my mind. I participated a lot in the lectures, group work and projects. I was very social, the people told me I was the most social person they met and that I should stay like this, never change as I was very friendly, funny, even integrating social outcasts or people with mental issues like depression, social anxiety or even Asperer. I wanted the best for everyone and tried my best to give people a good life and confidence as I knew how bad it was for me before phenibut and now I was able to gift people. Well phenibut made me kind of hypomanic as you could imagine. I had the feeling I could do anything, life was amazing, life was heaven. I never worried at all, I was happy all the time. I had great perspectives and ideas all the time. Future was safe for me. I could speak with every person, doesn't matter which age, gender or whatever. I could just go to a girl and flirt with her, change numbers, take her home at partys. I had so many dates, met so many different people and girls. Did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. Everything worked. What should I have worried about. Sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. I struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. It's no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven I experienced on phenibut, a total hell. I experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that I wouldn't wish my worst enemy. It was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. There was nothing I could do to against during this pain of hell. Very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.

**Today** I'm still studying luckily, I didn't give up but I was very close to. But depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. Future anxiety is big. What should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. How should I ever manage a job like this, find some people I'm able love and people that love me. How should I find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? I feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. Additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. Life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. Otherwise I wouldn't continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events I feel very disappointed of myself). I also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well and gives me good feelings about myself. On days I work I feel slightly better.

**If you read until here I want to thank you so much for ""hearing"" me.** I would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. According therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.

I want to **try a new medication** (as I already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in December, I already talked with my doc about it. I also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. My therapy seems quite **therapy resistent** at least according that what I tried. As I already said **I think my depression is mainly biological**. I don't know if it always have been like this as the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too. **In my depth psychological therapy I also learned** that **my older brother** played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. I don't want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. Additionally I grew up with my mother and brother alone, **father was not there** since I was 4. My mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. Maybe the **austerity and inurement from the father was missing**. Otherwise I was very **not-resilient and socially anxious since I was a small child**. Again: That's why I think the origin/source is biological. I also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance.",t2_3foqfuy5,False,,0,False,"My Depression, Alcohol Abuse, Heaven on Phenibut and Struggles from Today",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_k3a1w2,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606688147.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear guys and girls, dear sufferers, dear survivers,&lt;/p&gt;

It was not only about impressing them but also myself as being this psychologically disabled boy made me very depressive and sad. Another thing was my disabled cognition due to depression. Before phenibut I sat in universiy and didn&amp;#39;t understand a thing, I was socially anxious and panicful all the time. I spent much more attention to what this person 3 rows in front of me thinks about me, what the girl sitting 6 rows behind me would think about how I sat, when I would cough or give a strange sound from me. Thanks to phenibut I didn&amp;#39;t care, I could focus on the topics, not on the people around me and what they could think about me (even if they don&amp;#39;t care anyways, it was very paranoid and irrational thinking). I had the greatest idea, creativity and funny jokes on my mind. I participated a lot in the lectures, group work and projects. I was very social, the people told me I was the most social person they met and that I should stay like this, never change as I was very friendly, funny, even integrating social outcasts or people with mental issues like depression, social anxiety or even Asperer. I wanted the best for everyone and tried my best to give people a good life and confidence as I knew how bad it was for me before phenibut and now I was able to gift people. Well phenibut made me kind of hypomanic as you could imagine. I had the feeling I could do anything, life was amazing, life was heaven. I never worried at all, I was happy all the time. I had great perspectives and ideas all the time. Future was safe for me. I could speak with every person, doesn&amp;#39;t matter which age, gender or whatever. I could just go to a girl and flirt with her, change numbers, take her home at partys. I had so many dates, met so many different people and girls. Did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. Everything worked. What should I have worried about. Sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. I struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. It&amp;#39;s no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven I experienced on phenibut, a total hell. I experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that I wouldn&amp;#39;t wish my worst enemy. It was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. There was nothing I could do to against during this pain of hell. Very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m still studying luckily, I didn&amp;#39;t give up but I was very close to. But depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. Future anxiety is big. What should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. How should I ever manage a job like this, find some people I&amp;#39;m able love and people that love me. How should I find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? I feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. Additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. Life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. Otherwise I wouldn&amp;#39;t continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events I feel very disappointed of myself). I also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well and gives me good feelings about myself. On days I work I feel slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you read until here I want to thank you so much for &amp;quot;hearing&amp;quot; me.&lt;/strong&gt; I would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. According therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to &lt;strong&gt;try a new medication&lt;/strong&gt; (as I already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in December, I already talked with my doc about it. I also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. My therapy seems quite &lt;strong&gt;therapy resistent&lt;/strong&gt; at least according that what I tried. As I already said &lt;strong&gt;I think my depression is mainly biological&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t know if it always have been like this as the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too. &lt;strong&gt;In my depth psychological therapy I also learned&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;my older brother&lt;/strong&gt; played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. I don&amp;#39;t want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. Additionally I grew up with my mother and brother alone, &lt;strong&gt;father was not there&lt;/strong&gt; since I was 4. My mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. Maybe the &lt;strong&gt;austerity and inurement from the father was missing&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise I was very &lt;strong&gt;not-resilient and socially anxious since I was a small child&lt;/strong&gt;. Again: That&amp;#39;s why I think the origin/source is biological. I also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t even know how to talk to my friends about it because like it’s nothing new, I am just not okay and don’t know how to explain it without sounding like a fucking crazy person. I’m just done. With everything. I gotta re-learn to shut down my emotions and to stop caring about anything or anyone. I just gotta do that and keep it up until I stop waking up. I’ll get there one day I’m sure. Just can’t come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I figured out how to dress. A small thing, but as a man I never knew what is was like to receive a compliment on dress. Then this last week I went to a party and a friend told me that “I looked Iced out” and that he loved the fit. It meant so much to me to go from being called a “Dad” in public to looking my age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me feel a bit better just writing this stuff down. If anyone else would like to share progress I’d love to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"A few years ago, after a long time of being unhappy, almost suicidal and smoking away my life with pot to kill the thoughts and pain, I went to see a doctor and took anti depressants for some time.

My life took an awesome twist and I was able to pull myself out of the swamp. I found the love of my life, developed my career, quit smoking pot and do sports now which became a great passion. 
Now, years later I see some patterns showing up again that scare me. I just started a new job in a new branche and it's very hard. Especially with the Covid-19 situation, I spend most time in home office and wasn't able to connect to people and build a network. I'm not where I want to be yet.
My girlfriend is very loving and we have a lot of fun together, but there are some major issues about our future that I'm too afraid to talk about because I couldn't handle it in my current constitution. Traveling with friends and going for adventures gave me a lot in the past years, this literally died in 2020.

I feel tired all the time now, almost paralyzed.

I have horrible problems to focus, I'm always distracting myself with my phone. In work and school I'm useless because I literally can't focus on work for more than 10min, just to distract myself  with my phone addiction and then try another 10min.

I'm feeling lonely and distancing myself from friends. Minor things of friends piss me off, other things that I did or said make me cringe and worry me that they don't like me anymore. 

I wouldn't call myself an alcoholic, but drinking helps me to forget things for a few hours, so I drink about 2-3 days a week. Always just about 3-5 beers or the same in wine or cocktails.

I'm worried that the whole shit starts over. I hated the medicines because they made me tired and fat. Also I hated that they didn't cope with alcohol which is a big cultural part of going out and meeting friends where I life. I'm not talking to anyone of my friends and family about depression, I will never, no matter what people say. It's my secret, I don't want people to look at me this way. Judge me. Feel sorry.

I have days that are better. When I'm hiking, on my bike, being with friends and my girlfriend. But my general Monday to Saturdays are grey. I know these are all red flags, but I need to hear it.

I thought that I&amp;#39;d be able to meet new people once I entered college, but then COVID happened and now I&amp;#39;m just stuck in my room for almost the entire day. I&amp;#39;ve been alone for this entire year and it just hurts so much. I haven&amp;#39;t had any sort of suicidal ideations in months, but those thoughts are starting to surface again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what is the point of living? My parents and maybe a handful of friends might be sad for a little bit, but I&amp;#39;m starting to think that the world really would be better off without a complete waste of space like myself.&lt;/p&gt;

You can be the best of friends with those who you want to be. People really love having you around, I hope you know that. You really have friends even if you don’t see it that way. You are a better person than you can imagine. You don’t ever have to be afraid. You are a strong person, just look at what you have already accomplished, and the things you have survived. Just open your eyes and find the silver lining, in what you think didn’t go right in your life. You’re smart, you can figure your way through anything. You know what? If people got to know the real you, I think you would find a lot more people sticking around. You don’t ever have to do this alone, because there already are a lot of people out there who love you.

You helped me with my homework, just to take some of the load off me. You cherished all the good that was given to you, something as simple as a no. You give and give, you never expect anything back but you deserve a lot in return. You are so thankful for everything that is given to you and see the merit in thoughtfulness. You are not afraid of the rain or the snow or the thunder. You are so very strong. You always say you are sorry even when you don’t have to, just to make the other person happy. That’s the sign of a true woman, you are really are the “bigger man”. You cherish what you have and never seem to want more. You are so accepting of other people and the things they do or did. You have mercy for the poor, the sick, and the needy. Remember how you gave the cleaning guy medicine? Think about it. You make everyone around you feel better.  You talk to people to help them overcome their sadness, even when that’s not your burden. You put yourself last which is truly selfless. You are no coward, almost everything I’ve seen you do, shows me you are brave. You plan things which is great; it’s easy to get lost without a plan.

,depression,"I made this account two days ago for a few reasons.

My mom said it would be therapeutic for me to help others and to be able to talk about my depression.

I wanted a form of social media as an outlet.

Yesterday I posted on a few subreddits simply saying ""How are you?""

I did this because I would want somebody asking me how I feel. I thought that maybe I could help make someone's day. I didn't get any negative comments, but some people disliked my posts. Maybe I shouldn't take this so seriously, but I've been a mess emotionally for a while. I wish people could think about the fact that there's an actual person on the other end. And on this one post I did for r/sat , I was giving some grammar tips. Some person started being sarcastic and mean. Again, I just wanted to help people.

I truly believe that what goes around comes around and that I should try to help people in my small way. But the one second click it took for some people to dislike my posts made me cry. I feel like deleting reddit. I don't feel like reaching out anymore.

I have been struggling with depression for a few months now, and I thought reddit would help, but it's doing more harm than good to my mental health. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.

I might delete reddit but here's a message to you- if you don't like someone's post and it's not derogatory to you in any way, then just leave. Just leave and remember that there's a person on the other end.

Though I'm pretty sure nobody will even comment here to talk to me about what's going on, I've decided to post this anyway. I'm a special case compared to a lot of people in the sense that I have been disowned by my adoptive parents and my birth parents are neglectful drug addicts.

I have deep seated trust and abandonment issues stemming from my upbringing so I don't let friends help me when I need emotional support for fear that they'll abandon me because of my mental illnesses. Being abandoned because of my mental illnesses has become a norm in my life and every time it happens it drains more of the goodness out of me. I used to be cheerful, flirtatious and charming, but I've become cold, callous and bitter.

I just want someone to come into my life who wants to see me happy. I have nobody cheering me on. I have nobody for emotional support whatsoever and all I want is to be able to be hugged when I absolutely need one to stop from breaking down.


Everyone always tells me that I need to love myself before someone else can love me. The problem is I have never loved myself. I have never known what that is like and no matter how hard I try I just cant find any way to like anything about myself.

,depression,"It's so exhausting. My roommate A gets me to come out of my room to play a game. I'm like okay I'm feeling better and a nice game might be fun. 

So I get out there and I'm sitting there waiting for like 10 minutes as we wait for roommate B to finish something so they can join. 

I decided to go get on my computer real quick in my room and just do a little more job searching while we wait on roommate B. Literally two minutes later I walk out to grab a drink and they just started without me.

I'm 21yo guy, I cant enjoy anything, love or family or anything. Only thing I can still fell is sadness and loneliness. I feel like shit for 9 years. Nothing helped, I tried using meds from my psychiatrist but it didnt help at all. I felt even worse. Yesterday I visited my psychologist after 6months (I couldnt met her because of corona) And when I started talking I immediately wanted to cry because holding my feelings and thoughts inside my head for a long time is difficult. But it didnt help, talking is only worse because it reminds me of my suffering. I just want to get help or something that will cure me or change my personality, I cant live like that, Im just not strong enough. 

The worst part of it is nobody know about my pain. Not even my mother, I just can't tell her how I feel because it would hurt her. She thinks I'm fine and everything is fine. 

I've often thought about suicide this year. End my misery, end this fucking life and finally end my sadness. But the hardest thing for me would be to leave my mom without knowing what happened. And goodbye letter would hurt her even more. 

How can I change my life? What can I do ? Zero friends whole life, everybody thinks I'm weird because I'm quiet. But when I'm talking I can see in their eyes loosing interest in me.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 21yo guy, I cant enjoy anything, love or family or anything. Only thing I can still fell is sadness and loneliness. I feel like shit for 9 years. Nothing helped, I tried using meds from my psychiatrist but it didnt help at all. I felt even worse. Yesterday I visited my psychologist after 6months (I couldnt met her because of corona) And when I started talking I immediately wanted to cry because holding my feelings and thoughts inside my head for a long time is difficult. But it didnt help, talking is only worse because it reminds me of my suffering. I just want to get help or something that will cure me or change my personality, I cant live like that, Im just not strong enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part of it is nobody know about my pain. Not even my mother, I just can&amp;#39;t tell her how I feel because it would hurt her. She thinks I&amp;#39;m fine and everything is fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve often thought about suicide this year. End my misery, end this fucking life and finally end my sadness. But the hardest thing for me would be to leave my mom without knowing what happened. And goodbye letter would hurt her even more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I change my life? What can I do ? Zero friends whole life, everybody thinks I&amp;#39;m weird because I&amp;#39;m quiet. But when I&amp;#39;m talking I can see in their eyes loosing interest in me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for this messy post, but I just wanted to vent. Thank you for your attention. And if you maybe want to talk with me, I will be waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi everyone, I’m not one to usually post but... I’ve found myself in a really dark place recently, and figured I’d reach out to others struggling to seek guidance. 

I’m a 21 yr old female living in California. I go to school full time and work part time. I was recently diagnosed with COVID and have fallen extremely behind in my classes, and have received a lot of criticism from peers since my diagnosis. People blamed me for being sick, shunned me, and left me to “think about my actions,and how they affect others”. I’ve been confined to a room for weeks, with the school monitoring my every move..I’m feeling extremely suicidal and overall just very sad and lost.

I have finals next week, and an overwhelming amount of homework due, but all I can find the strength to do is sleep,eat,cry, repeat. I’m struggling to write my essays or study for my exams. 

I’m really worried about my mental health. I had a therapist who, because of the semester ending, had ended our sessions a few days ago. 

My mother, is putting a lot of pressure on me to do well in school, and I’m letting her and my whole family down. I’m currently facing a potential explosion from college for problems with my roommate and I having a guest over at the dorms ... 

So all in all... I’m about to fail all my classes. Get kicked out of college, and need to find a new place to live within a few weeks... I can barely get out of bed ... and I’ve gained over 50 pounds in the last 3 months... I need help. I’m scared..

I’m also having a lot of problems with my boyfriend who; since me becoming depressed and gaining weight has seemingly lost interest in me... 

I apologize if my writing seems just like I’m complaining , I hate to be that girl... but I don’t know who else to talk to right now.. 

How do you cope when you feel like the world is crashing down on you? How do you find happiness again? I feel like everything that used to make me so happy like dance (and also my current major), hasn’t made me feel good in a long time...

I really want to die right now, as in today. Now. and maybe even doxx the girl that set me up, and ruined my life through lies, and has driven me to this head space. Honestly I could sue the crap out of her and probably win but at that point it costs so much money, time, and you have to relive all of the terrible things that happened, multiple times. The defense will do everything in their power to try to prove that you’re a piece of shit and the claims are untrue. That process would probably make me feel even worse. 

I know that I’m not alone in this battle of my brain literally torturing itself 24/7, so to me it really doesn’t matter that I’m not “alone.” I’ve been screwed over by so many people that I deeply cared about and that has caused me to isolate from everyone else and I really like it that way. 

My question is, does anyone who knows what struggle I’m talking about have any eye bleach or whatever you call it? A link to a video, article, picture, or story that made them smile or they thought was very wholesome?
