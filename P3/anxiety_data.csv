,Anxiety,"With 2020 shaping up to be an extremely difficult year, we have decided to move towards a more general type of megathread. On this thread we are going to promote mental health-related discussion centered on any stressful events that are going on right now.

In addition, we will use this thread to attempt to compile various different resources (mainly useful, more specific discussion threads) as well as provide a generic place to discuss anything related to what is happening this year. We will be updating this post as often as possible. If we identify any new posts that will serve as good additions to our “Discussion Links” section we’ll add them. Feel free to suggest any, even if it’s your own post!

**Guidelines**

We expect that some discussion will revolve around politically-themed issues. These are allowed, but we request that the discussion stays about the impact it has had on your own mental health or the people around you.

We are not here to debate this versus that, to try and tear each other down or to shame people for struggling to cope with all that is happening. Instead we want to foster an environment that allows people to talk about the mental issues they’ve been encountering and to provide support.

If any comment or post seems to be getting way too heated, please report them and we will do our best to handle the situation.

If you are sharing links or news, please remember to *consider the source*.  If you are feeling outraged or upset by a headline, take the article with a grain of salt and remember that whoever is writing it may have something to gain just from getting a high number of clicks.  

**How To Suggest New Links**

There are two ways that you can get new links added to this post. This is one instance where self-promotion is okay in the sense that if the link is something you made (such as a Reddit discussion post), that is alright.

1. Make a comment on this post with the suggestion + link, and include the word ‘mods’ in the comment. This is the preferred way since it will also allow other people to weigh in on the suggestion.
1. Send us a private mod mail with the suggestion + link.

We can’t guarantee that every suggestion will be approved but we’ll review each one regardless.

&lt;p&gt;How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‘t feel the same fear as you do in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.&lt;/p&gt;

Anxiety is like hitting that brick wall over and over again and hoping that maybe one slate will come loose; spoiler alert it never does. 
Anxiety is the tightening of your chest, getting in an ambulance and hoping you’re in cardiac arrest. Anxiety is circling the drain, hoping that it will suck you in and you’ll never surface, that the oxygen is too far away. Anxiety is replaying memories and thinking what you could have done and what you didn’t do. Anxiety is not talking to friends and family for weeks, months, years and you’re too scared to contact them, they’ll forget about you anyway. Every day is the same and you believe you can’t change. It’s not wanting to meet up with anyone. Or making plans and quickly pulling out; your four walls are the comfort you want. Anxiety is people believing you’re being self centred, that you’re just lazy. Anxiety feels like a huge hole in your head, burning every day as you try and process normal things like a human. It feels like fire in the nerves whenever you need to answer the phone; finding an excuse to quickly turn the cell over and ignore it. It’s the feeling of nothing, of the nights you cried yourself to sleep. It’s the feeling that you’ll never see the end of the day, even though it’s 11PM. A never ending cycle that seems to be a ground hog day. Depression is deeper, it sticks to you like glue. Everywhere you go, you catch a glimpse of a family member who’s no longer here. You lie at night, your heart thumping in your ears and the memories replaying. For me, it’s my uncle G lying in his coffin.

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is like hitting that brick wall over and over again and hoping that maybe one slate will come loose; spoiler alert it never does. 
Anxiety is the tightening of your chest, getting in an ambulance and hoping you’re in cardiac arrest. Anxiety is circling the drain, hoping that it will suck you in and you’ll never surface, that the oxygen is too far away. Anxiety is replaying memories and thinking what you could have done and what you didn’t do. Anxiety is not talking to friends and family for weeks, months, years and you’re too scared to contact them, they’ll forget about you anyway. Every day is the same and you believe you can’t change. It’s not wanting to meet up with anyone. Or making plans and quickly pulling out; your four walls are the comfort you want. Anxiety is people believing you’re being self centred, that you’re just lazy. Anxiety feels like a huge hole in your head, burning every day as you try and process normal things like a human. It feels like fire in the nerves whenever you need to answer the phone; finding an excuse to quickly turn the cell over and ignore it. It’s the feeling of nothing, of the nights you cried yourself to sleep. It’s the feeling that you’ll never see the end of the day, even though it’s 11PM. A never ending cycle that seems to be a ground hog day. Depression is deeper, it sticks to you like glue. Everywhere you go, you catch a glimpse of a family member who’s no longer here. You lie at night, your heart thumping in your ears and the memories replaying. For me, it’s my uncle G lying in his coffin. My mum saying to touch his hand, then when I did she said it warmed to me; although it was stone cold. I went outside, sat on the cold step, looked to the stars and put my earphones in. I cried. I must have cried for 2 hours before anyone even came looking. I grew up fast from this, I was only 12. I knew my uncle george was in that room, or the carcass of my uncle G Depression is in your marrowbone, it seeps like fungi and weighs you down. You cry. For me, I feel everything.

,Anxiety,"Hello, for a few weeks I’ve just been stuck with the thoughts that i’m gonna die one day, i’m going to lose my parents one day, my cats are most likely going to die in 10-15 years, I don’t want a new life when I die I don’t want to sleep forever and just not exist, I don’t want my memories to be gone when I die and forget the people I love and many more related thoughts. Those thoughts make me feel anxious for the whole day, I just cannot talk with my parents without having those thoughts and do even something like look at clothes online and think why if we all are going to die, it feels like i’m stuck and it feels like I don’t want to live in this world. Also because of this I have a really big fear of the future and aging. I’m currently 17, i’m still young and i’m almost 18, it scares me. I know it is just a number and nothing really changes, but I don’t want to, it feels like yesterday when I was just little and I miss my childhood untill 11 years old. I miss being innocent and little. Since I started to have these nostalgic feelings and thoughts and missing my childhood I started to change, I couldn’t stand makeup anymore, things I used to like in my teens. I only find comfort in things of when I was a child, I basically want to be a child again, and my parents to be younger.. and that is so impossible but I can’t handle it.. in my 12’s things started to change and from my 14 till 15 I was really rebellious and treated my parents really badly and a lot of things I did then and what happened to me I really regret to this day, and I just also feel this big guilt on my shoulders towards my parents for how I was at that time, a lot of guilt that I spent at my 14,15 doing shit that just ruined my innocence. I’m currently in a 2 year relationship and since then I changed a lot and became a better person, which matters. And I love my parents more than ever but the guilt is eating me. I’m not going to tell everything because it will be too long and has not a lot to do with my title. But I LOVE MY PARENTS VERY MUCH. 
Since this July i’ve started to have intrusive thoughts which switched to a lot of other themes fucked up themes , causing me panic attacks. Kinda looks like OCD to me, I still haven’t been diagnosed and I’m getting therapy and went to a psychiatrist, but because i’m having really bad sleep problems she only prescribed something to sleep. I’m going back there in 3 weeks and I hope I get something like antidepressants, because since July it never stopped. Now I’m really depressed, not being able to do anything and only guilt feelings and negative thoughts are what I live with everyday. But these kind of thoughts I have about my and other people’s mortality, aging and the future, that I miss my childhood and just want to go back are stuck now with me everyday and it never stops. I still haven’t talked about my therapist about it because we are discussing about my past and my guilt feelings but I’m definitely going to bring this one up Tuesday.

,Anxiety,"So just for some quick backstory:

I emailed an old teacher last week about how uni was going and she never replied. The first few days I was always anxiously checking my inbox and just sleeping the hours away so I didnt have to be awake an feel so anxious. Then after a few days I resigned myself to the fact I wouldnt get a response. And my head started filling with stupid thoughts that I was a burden and that they didnt want to stay in contact. But I didnt think I was feeling anxious or depressed about them responding. The thoughts I was having were, to me, perfectly valid and definitely why I hadn't got a response.

I know it sounds stupid that an old teacher replying to me was that important but this was and still is a really important relationship to me even if it slightly one sided. And deep down I know is a big part of why I'm still here today.  They were the first adult I had felt comfortable around (except for my mum) in over a decade (and I'm only 19) if not all my life.  

But I checked my inbox this evening looking for something completely different stuff not expecting there to be a reply and if anything feeling depressed that everytime I had to email someone or look for something in my emails I was reminded that they hadn't replied.

 But I noticed they had finally responded. The relief and happiness was immense. I havent done any uni work for the last week and i wasnt sure why. I hadn't realised how big of an effect it was having on me that I didnt get a reply. But now that I have got that relief i know how bad it was. And I know that thinking that I was a burden and nobody wants to talk to me and I'm annoying is just the anxiety and depression talking. I honestly thought it was a completely acceptable reason that they didnt reply to me. Even though I know that most people wouldnt encourage someone to stay in contact if they didnt truly want to.

,Anxiety," **What is Anxiety?**

The feeling of excessive worrying or anxiousness that a person gets when they have to face a stressful situation is known as anxiety. People describe this feeling as having butterflies in the stomach. Everyone experiences anxiety at some point in their life. Having feelings of anxiousness before an event like giving a speech, appearing for a job interview, or showing up for the first day in school, is very common.

Short-term anxiety is the natural response of our bodies to a stressful situation, and it does not require any medical attention, as such symptoms fade away after the stressful event is over. For some people, symptoms of anxiety might last for much more extended periods like for years. People with long-lasting anxiety need medical attention to treat their anxiety disorder.

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of going to therapists who don’t really seemed to know how to get to my inner problems.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on what to look for in a therapist who specializes in my problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be a million psych specializations out there.  I get lost trying to figure out who I one can help me.&lt;/p&gt;

As you can see from the title, I skipped one of my classes two times because of something that happened. Of course I was there during attendance, but I left immediately after. The reason for me doing this, which I never wanted to do because I’m a good student, is because we had to work in partners. Yup. Not groups, but partners. I’d rather work in small groups because then I wouldn’t have to initiate the conversation. I didn’t want to work with someone I didn’t know. (Mind you that google meets generates random partners in breakout rooms) I have major anxiety (I’m going to see a psychologist in a few days) so being forced to talk with people usually triggers me. Last week was the first time that I skipped class for this class. I didn’t skip on purpose, my internet went out so I obviously used that as an excuse to why I didn’t continue attending the class. Today we had to continue working on the assigned work. The teacher was asking who our partners were, I didn’t have a partner so I immediately turned off my wifi with no second thought and took a photo of my screen so I could send it to the teacher so he’d believe me. I’m panicking right now because the classwork is due today and I have nothing done because I have ni idea what we’re supposed to do.

,Anxiety,"Hey everyone. New to Reddit here. I don't know where to start but I know I have to start somewhere. I will try my best to explain how I feel. First of all, i'll introduce myself. My name is Anthony and I'm 24 years old. I've been having some "" attacks "" or not sure if they really are attacks that I'm experiencing. I experienced my first attack back in 2015, I was playing video games when it happened, as I was playing I felt like I was going to pass out so I instantly went to the bathroom to try and calm myself down.. as days went by I didn't think nothing of it. But first let me say that before the attack happened, I felt totally fine, I wasn't mad, depressed, or anything like that. I was completetly fine. So anyways, fast forward a few days later I get the attack again, and the exact same feeling aswell, I felt like I was going to pass out, so maybe I thought there was something wrong with me so I decided to go to the hospital so they could do blood tests on me to see if anything was wrong and a few days later I got my results back, and again, I was completetly fine, so I thought that was strange. As time went by I got more attacks, and the more I got them, the more I started to feel more things if that makes any sense. Literally now when I get these attacks, I can feel them coming, before they happen I start to feel weird.. it's really hard to explain, like my body feels weird, sometimes I'll start to feel as if im moving like a robot or something or like waves going on in my head and then seconds later that's when the attack hits me, and when it does, I instantly get nauseous, I feel like im going to pass out, my heart starts to beat a little faster and I also get the chills all at the same time! And while the attack is happening, it makes me want to go to the hospital but I don't because I'm sure they will say nothing is wrong with me. Sometimes the attacks feel like deja vu because they always feel the exact same. It's never any different, it's never any better nor worse. It's just always the exact same feeling. But anyways, as soon as the attack happens, wherever im at, I instantly go to the bathroom and I splash water on my face to calm myself down, while trying to catch my breathe. I noticed that when the attack happens and I stay still, it feels so much worse, it's like if I have to move so it won't feel as intense. Each episode usually lasts about 5 seconds.. and those 5 seconds feel horrible.. After the attacks happen, sometimes im left feeling depressed because I ask myself why am I getting these for no reason? Also the attacks make me feel different, like I just don't feel like my old self.. It's like one moment I  feel good and then the next moment I will start to feel bad. Sometimes the attacks make me feel physically sick for a few hours, sometimes a day or two. These attacks used to happen about once every month, then every 3 weeks, then every 2 weeks and now it's every week.. Sometimes I even wake up to an attack while I'm sleeping. I've had anxiety for years now. There is also some days where I feel random andrenaline rushes, but I'm not so sure if that's part of the anxiety. I can feel relaxed doing nothing and then out of nowhere I will start to feel an attack coming, or even if I see certain movements on tv or while im playing a game, causes me to have an attack. I've never had a seizure and I don't have epilepsy. It's like anything now causes me to have an attack..I feel depressed because I don't know what's wrong with me.. it's now 2020 and I'm still getting these attacks to this day. I'm finally breaking my silence after 5 years, I've only told my family, and they think it's probably anxiety, and the reason for not saying or telling anyone is because I didn't know what I felt nor did I know how to put it in words and I didn't wanna sound like I was going crazy... For anyone reading this, I apologize if I'm all over the place or if I didn't make any sense in some parts but I just hope that there is someone out there who can relate to me and help me out.

,Anxiety,"Hey guys. Coming down from an anxiety attack so this is probably rambly af. 

This morning I had to drop my software bootcamp/class. I have been attempting to succeed there for a little less than a year now, but with everything being the way that it is, I'm not able to continue. 

My anxiety has been ramping up like crazy as I have fallen more and more behind. Finally I was issued an ultimatum by my instructors, and after mulling it over, I understand that it is in my best interest (mentally and emotionally) to leave. I have had nightmares every night for months from stress. I can't quit my job. So school fell by the wayside until I got so far behind I was never going to be truly caught up with my peers. 

So I had to gut myself basically and message my main instructor and tell her that this is not working for me. I hope there are some options going forward. I loved my class and my instructors too. They tried so hard to help me and I didn't let them and now I'm here. I wish I could do it all over again. But I don't actually know if I would be any better. 

Honestly I think stepping back from Big Goals and moving into a mindset of healing and recovery could benefit me. I have always wanted to push myself very hard. I hold myself to the same standard as everyone else even with my anxiety and depression. But it's taken so long to even get started working on those parts of myself. 

Right now I am feeling like an enormous failure that had once again disappointed the people who believed in me. That is a tough pill to swallow. 

Any advice, support, or virtual hugs would be appreciated right now. I'm feeling like scum of the earth and am going to have to wait until my instructors reply to know if I can ever try this program again or not. So all I can think about is how my dream/goal is destroyed, what will I do now?

So school fell by the wayside until I got so far behind I was never going to be truly caught up with my peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had to gut myself basically and message my main instructor and tell her that this is not working for me. I hope there are some options going forward. I loved my class and my instructors too. They tried so hard to help me and I didn&amp;#39;t let them and now I&amp;#39;m here. I wish I could do it all over again. But I don&amp;#39;t actually know if I would be any better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I think stepping back from Big Goals and moving into a mindset of healing and recovery could benefit me. I have always wanted to push myself very hard. I hold myself to the same standard as everyone else even with my anxiety and depression. But it&amp;#39;s taken so long to even get started working on those parts of myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am feeling like an enormous failure that had once again disappointed the people who believed in me. That is a tough pill to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice, support, or virtual hugs would be appreciated right now. I&amp;#39;m feeling like scum of the earth and am going to have to wait until my instructors reply to know if I can ever try this program again or not. So all I can think about is how my dream/goal is destroyed, what will I do now? Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had dreams of finding him on tinder, obsessing over the belief he resented me, believing he didn’t really love me, that he was lying to my face about still wanting me just to make me feel better — the anxiety/ocd usual.

But he now confirms nearly all the things I’ve been suspecting and blaming on my anxiety: the resentment, the tinder, the lust and longing, the spite, the lying.

,Anxiety,"I graduated from undergrad about 5 years ago and never got a job in my field. I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn’t understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

,Anxiety,"Hi there. I have a bit of a back story.  about 2 years ago, I had chest pains, all of a sudden. This was during night, and I got so shit scared I went to the hospital. Upon doing various tests and whatnot, they couldn't find anything wrong, such as heart problems or anything. They ended up finding that I had a chest infection, and when I initially had these chest pains, I got so scared, and suffered symptoms of a heart attack, such as shortness of breath, pain in arms, etc. Thankfully, there is nothing wrong with my heart to this day, it ended up being a chest infection and I was prescribed antibiotics.  

Just last night, I got some sensations in my chest, not pain per se, but rather radiating sensations, and this caused me to lose my shit. I started panicking and these sensations got worse, but I tried to calm down, breath slowly, and it went down. Even when my mind was calm, and I knew there was nothing wrong with me, I still kept on getting these sensations every sometimes few seconds to a minute. I know there is nothing physically wrong with me, that's confirmed by doctors. But how the fuck do I stop my body from doing this? Every time I get sensations in my chest, by body goes into flight/fight mode, and feels like I have this rush of adrenaline, even when I calm down, it's like my body is telling me I'm in danger. I could be lying down, thinking happy thoughts, then BOOM, I get these sensations. All of these panic attacks started to happen after the initial hospital visit.

Long story short: I'm a relatively healthy male in his 30s, living in the US with lifelong severe anxiety and panic disorders. I've been diagnosed everything from having nearly every generalized anxiety-related disorder (OCD, PTSD, etc.), all the way up to manic depression (specifically, Bipolar II). I took meds for several years in my early twenties but ceased all prescriptions for about a decade. Two years ago it became too much to tolerate on my own, so I went back to my doctor again. After many, MANY different trial-and-errors, we finally landed on a regimen of Buspirone, a beta blocker (for essential tremor) and 1mg of clonazepam up to 3x daily. Most days, I'd average just one clonazepam. However, it wasn't uncommon to have a bad enough day to warrant the second or third dose, sometimes taking my full daily prescription's worth.

Naturally, the clonazepam's potency decreased drastically throughout the past two years and it led to taking more of it, more often. The classic story! After falling into abusive patterns from time-to-time (including sometimes foolishly mixing it with alcohol), I realized I had fallen into a vicious loop and was on a scary entrance ramp to a highway I did not want to merge onto. I was experiencing bouts of amnesia from time to time, I said and did things EXTREMELY unlike myself, and realized I wasn't too deep in where I could still change things on my own volition. So. I cold-turkey stopped taking the clonazepam (I know the taper method is the proper way to get off, but I felt disgusted and disappointed in myself and just wanted to stop ASAP).

It's been ten days today since I last took it, and it's been a horrendously horrible ride. All the hallmarks of withdrawal - impossibly awful sleep loss/disturbances, physiological effects, rebound anxiety/depression, the works. I've been able to muscle through it until this evening when I experienced one of the worst panic attacks I've had in YEARS. My wife and I agreed I should take 0.75mg of her Xanax as the attack was incredibly acute and needed to be addressed with something at least. My physician was unavailable this evening and still isn't aware that I cold-turkey stopped. I've improved a bit since, but still just trying to strong-arm the rest of the night and hopefully will get some rest soon.

All in all, I know there's a LOT of issues with my story and my game plan on getting off of it. After tonight's attack, I fully plan on talking to my doctor when they're available this week and figure out a better way to treat these issues with something less spooky, but I'm also curious if those who have gone through this sort of thing before with benzodiazepines have any stories, advice, or general knowledge you could share about your own experiences. Once again, I am not requesting nor advocating unlicensed medical assistance, I will work out decisions with my doctor - I just want to hear your stories or insight if you're willing to share.

I drew short webtoon comic stories about wholesome act from people's tweets or stories. People seems to enjoy it really much.

I blaming myself as not good enough compare to other comic artist. I blame to thing that if I have a tablet, it woukd make it much easier (bc I made my comic on phone with no pen). I blame my self for not getting much likes for my comics as equivalent to I did a terrible job.

When I start sketching outa new comic episode, I fell inadequate, my confident drop low. And I just can't bring myself up despite people said that they really like my comics and can't wait for new episode came out.

I think part of it because I never feel good enough from childhood until adulthood (now 20s). My parents never encourage or give any compliment for my drawing skills. They are typical Asian parent (and we aren't live in US) so they don't see any good in drawing at a career. 
 They always compare me to others, at how good they are and that I need to fell ashame for not doing as good at others kids. 

And if you are not good at them then don't bother doing anything.

It's really suck and frustrated. I just want to scream my loud it and talk back to them but that is an unacceptable and I will be look down on. 

They really taght me to listen to them at all cost. And they told me all the negative things about how incompetent I am and they expected me to be as good as I possibly can?!! When our relatives giving me a bad judgement about me in front of my parents. They didn't say anything back and just accepting that I am bad. What do you taught me is that I should not stand up for myself when others who don't know me and gave me a bad judgement. I should just keep quiet and accept that i am that bad person!

And what do my parents expect I am coming out of that teaching?!! A successful, confident woman?! Who doesn't need to stand up for herself when people have false judgement  about her, who just silently listen to what others has to said about herself and always accept that it's a right judgement about herself?!

It doesn't work like that, what it comes out is Me! An overly crippling anxiety , low confident , low self-esteem is what you will get! That's how your kid coming out when you taught her to not to fight back at others and your wrong judgement.

-she’s 14, has an older brother (15), has a good relationship with him. Not overly close/best friends, but they share friends a lot so hang out in groups and enjoy each others company
-her dad and I divorced when she was 6. Fairly amicable, but he displays traits that are definitely consistent with narcissism and she has to see him every other weekend.  
-she has a very difficult time falling asleep most nights. Drinks no caffeine, eats a mostly healthy diet, is a healthy weight and she plays a competitive sport. She said when she tries to fall asleep she sometimes has visual hallucinations that get more vivid when she closes her eyes, so she tries to keep her eyes open as long as possible. 
-sometimes has tactile hallucinations during the day, like someone is tapping on her arms. Not sure if this is on days that she is sleep deprived or not
-has feelings of certain areas of the house being more safe than other areas. We just moved to this house a month ago, and she seems to love the house, had a part in choosing the house and chose her bedroom. It’s in a very safe, quiet area, so “should” feel safe all around. The areas that feel more unsafe are the areas with the most visibility to the street, ie windows that don’t have blinds or curtains yet. 
- I read a few posts and someone mentioned sighing and taking deep breaths  a lot. She does this, some times more than others, and has for several years. 
-is in honors classes and gets A’s and B’s. Her sport is more for fun, she does not plan to play in college and may not next season, even.

I've also quit many jobs because of it. I would be in the middle of a task and then need to go home because the noise from people chatter made me dissociate.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also quit many jobs because of it. I would be in the middle of a task and then need to go home because the noise from people chatter made me dissociate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the same with touch. Which again, sometimes makes being in a relationship with me very difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even wondered if I wasn&amp;#39;t on the autism spectrum or anything (which my therapist absolutely comforted me in saying that it isn&amp;#39;t the case). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone feels the same? Anyone have some advice?&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have worked in a very stressful industry for about 8 years and several years ago I was “thrown to the wolves” by my terrible bosses that resulted in me having to “wing it” or “fly by the seat of my pants” with clients on major dollar projects.

Long story short when I first got into this industry my bosses were terrible and offered zero guidance and I think it’s given me a permanent condition that I cannot seem to overcome. I was dumped onto massive projects with absolutely zero managerial oversight/ or experience and had some pretty crazy ups and downs during this time. I’d have straight up panic attacks in business meetings with a dozen people in them. I’d keep it together and bulldoze through the meeting but physically it would be obvious I was having severe anxiety issues. Extreme sweat, trembling hands, fumbling words, etc. very embarrassing. 

Fast forward 5+ years and I’ve still never overcome this. I can go into a business meeting with a client I’ve known for years and it’s like I’m in 8th grade giving a speech to a class without my pants on. 🥴

I’ve tried: lexapro, Xanax, Effexor, alcohol (lol), THC, CBD, some therapy. 

It’s gotten to a point where I experience this half the time in my own office when speaking to my boss. Wtf!? 

Only things that seem to work are unhealthy alternatives. Xanax only works if i take 2.0+ mg and it causes me to black out. Alcohol isn’t a healthy alternative and is out of the question. 

Anyone else experience this? Anytime I’m near my boss or clients I am a different person. Timid, anxious, panicked, on edge, sweaty, etc. 

Any suggestions? Ready to quit my job at this point.

,Anxiety,"Hi there I’m a 24 year old female who has struggled with anxiety my whole life. Recently my anxiety has reached a whole new level, I had to leave my university because I was too afraid to go outside or to class. In class I would have panic attacks and it was terrible. I also passed out while driving during a stressful time and ended up in a small creek. I thank the universe every day I didn’t hurt anyone. Some nice man crawled through the mud to get me out of the car, and a nice lady held me while I was hysterical.

,Anxiety,"Ever since I was a teen, I thought there was something ""wrong"" with me. I've always known that I was an anxious person. However, I always performed well in school and was able to get by in life decently, so I figured it was nothing serious enough to pursue. However, 2020 has thrown that completely out the window. There are multiple things that have happened this year, and I felt like I was struggling each step of the way. But I was still holding it together. I was able to perform really well during my summer internship at a prestigious, household name company. I was almost certain that I was going to get a return offer, where I will start a full-time employee with them next year after I graduate. In fact, if it wasn't 2020, that's exactly what would have happened.

But the company only had room for a few select interns due to COVID, and I didn't make the cut.

My depression and anxiety were destroying me before I got the news that I wasn't getting a return offer, but now it's even worse. Beforehand, it was difficult to get out of bed. I would do my Zoom classes or my work meetings in bed, with my camera off. I'd put in the bare minimum work. I'd sleep for as long as I could, take in naps. Now that I've gotten the news, I'm just in a constant state of worry.

Worried that I'm not going to pass my classes this quarter because I can't focus long enough to get any work done. Worried that I'm not going to find a job. That I'm missing every opportunity. That I need to do XYZ things in order to obtain XYZ benefits. For a few days, my anxiety cancelled out my depression and propelled me to get a lot of work done. Now I'm stuck in a procrastination loop. 

Any time that I'm not actively distracted by something (i.e. hanging out with my new boyfriend, hanging out with friends, playing video games, etc), I feel like I'm drowning. 

Before 2020, before so many things in my life changed, I felt that I had a firm idea of what my future was supposed to look like. I specifically planned it out and crafted it to be this way. Now I have no idea what my future will look like, and I can't handle it. 

I used to be able to manage my anxiety to a point where I performed well. I excelled. I was a role model. Now I feel like I'm failing.

if you're feeling depressed, remember that there are resources that you can use to ask for help.

if you're feeling angry, take a breath, maybe take a hot shower, and then get the rest you deserve.

if you're regretful, let go of the mistakes you made in the past and focus on how you can improve in the future.

if you're feeling lonely, remember that there's always someone there.

if   you're stressed out about school and homework, ask for help from the   teacher, stop procrastinating on homework, and get the rest you deserve.

if  you're feeling suicidal, remember that you are special and that you  have a purpose, and remember that it's okay to ask for help.

if you're worn out or tired, grab a blanket and some hot cocoa, and get the rest you deserve.

if you don't like the way you look, remember that you're perfect just the way you are.

if  you are any these things, remember that you are amazing. Remember to  love yourself. You are special, amazing, and talented. You are unique.   You are a snowflake; there are never two same snowflakes. Love yourself.   Be kind to others. And if something is bothering you, what is it?

I haven’t been able to find a job because of the pandemic. I worked my ass off to get two bachelors, (one of which is for a foreign language that’s common in my country) and worked abroad twice while doing my undergrad.

,Anxiety,"So I’m 27 and have been living in a city with roommates for the past few years. Back at the start of COVID, I moved home with my family in the suburbs, as it was feeling really hard to stay sane while quarantining with so many roommates in a small house. 
The past 9 months with my family has been great, for the most part. I miss my friends and being in the city, but it’s been really nice to be with family. My family is super close, especially me and my sister and I haven’t lived with them in a while, so it’s been a good experience. 
My mom is a stay at home mom and has been doing the bulk of the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. I’ve been helping out as much as she’ll let me, but I am afraid of becoming complacent now that I don’t have to do those things. 
I never intended to be here for 9 months, so I’ve been looking at one bedrooms and thinking about moving out if I find something good. Then the other week, I found a great apartment in my favorite neighborhood of the city, with cheaper rent due to covid (it would typically be hard for me to live in this area). I was excited and thought I should jump on it. 
Now that I just got approved for the apartment, I am starting to feel freaked out instead of excited. I’m a people person and have never lived alone before (I was initially hoping to get a roommate but that’s not possible as my friends are all living with their partners). 
I’m worried with COVID that I’ll be lonely and regret this decision, as if I keep living at home I’ll have company and will save money. On the other hand, I did pay off my student debt during quarantine, this a great place, and it seems like we’ll have a vaccine soon and things are getting better.

Another time, he said he sometimes won’t open texts for a while because of anxiety. Then it was that he went to bed early because his sleep schedule was messed up. And most recently it was a detailed message about how he’s in constant depression and anxiety and it’s a challenge to survive.

I’m 20 and he’s 58 but the thing is, he has been through hell his entire life and it shows.

He’s told me that it’s a waste of time and energy worrying about the inevitable and that I need to cherish the time that I have with him but it’s so hard when I’m constantly consumed with the fear of being lost and alone. I keep having memories of when I was a child and the things we did together but now I look at my pops and see him aging and it makes me want to run and sob. I’m so afraid to fall asleep because I’m scared I’ll wake up and not have my best friend any longer.

I've been battling some reflux lately and I've had a few people recommend I look into ""my anxiety"" as a cause. This was news to me being that I wasn't aware I had anxiety! While I know this isn't a place for a diagnosis and I do plan to speak to a mental health professional this week, I wanted to share a short incident that today lead my wife, who used to work in the mental health field, to say, ""THAT is anxiety.""

We were working in the backyard while our 3 kids played inside. I heard a car door shut and my first thought...like an instant / didn't-have-a-chance-to-catch-it thought...was that someone parked out front and would come in and take our children.

Now I've never been in a kidnapping situation. We live in a quiet, very safe neighborhood on a cul de sac. This thought is completely irrational and not something I would consciously think. My question to the group here is - can anxiety present in sort of a subconscious way? 

I'm normally very high strung. I get angry quickly. Can never make decisions. Don't sleep well and often find my shoulder pulled up near my ears and have this crawling sensation on my face. This has become more prevalent during COVID. But I feel FINE. It's like another part of me has anxiety but I feel normal. 

I discussed with my PCP and he mentioned Lexapro but said I should talk to a therapist first. I'm fully committed to understanding the concept of anxiety but want to make sure I don't end up down a Dr Google rabbit hole of despair.

I’m fairly new to Reddit so forgive me if I format anything incorrectly. So the last few weeks I’ve been getting really nauseous and have been feeling absolutely horrible.

This is my very first time producing a film, but I have a great team behind me who are also passionate about this topic. The film is called Good Girls, and it's an educational short film that will be used to help educate about mental awareness &amp; anxiety disorders, inspire individuals experiencing symptoms to seek help, and to share about the process one might take and treatment options for alleviating the struggles of anxiety.

Currently, we have our crew, locations, and we are casting, but our major goal is to build a community around the film. We were wondering if you would be interested in joining our facebook group which is used to support each other and provide resources.

,Anxiety,"Recently my family visited my brother's home with our dog and unfortunately came across ticks. My dog wears a small shirt and we saw one (a nymph) crawling on her shirt. We took it off and checked her but didn't find anything. I am someone with very extreme anxiety about ticks. I have bad anxiety in general but ticks are something that scare me so bad. 

Fast forward to last night when I was in my brother's home and found another nymph crawling along my blanket. Immediately I was freaking out. I felt like they were just all over me at that point. We left early to come home from our trip because of it and I got a shower immediately. I checked my body for anything and didn't find anything, but am still worried about something being in my hair. 

We bathed our dog and unfortunately found two ticks on her. Another nymph and one that sort of looked like it had been feeding for a bit, both at the same entrypoint. I stepped up and was the one to remove them, but have been feeling sick and lightheaded since this whole thing started and it's taken a lot out of me to calm myself down to the point where I don't faint. I've felt like I was on the verge of it for a couple times now.

Here is where I need the advice. I am freaking out thinking they're on me now. On our things. On my dog even more than what we found. Are they going to fall off and attach on us in the home?  Are they going to lay eggs inside our house and cause an infestation? Can they crawl from my dog and go on us instead??

These questions have been running through my mind all night long. It may seem like such an overreaction but they are something that have really scared me for most of my life. I havent been able to get any sleep and I'm scratching my body so much that I've begun to practically give myself marks from how hard I'm just panicing and itching THINKING that somethings on me. I also had lice as a kid and that's traumatized me to these small pests that I'm just freaking out.

I've cross posted this on thr r/DogAdvice subreddit to get more help for my dog on her side, but here I think I need more help for myself. I haven't been able to calm myself down since this happened and know ticks aren't a big deal to hunters and more woodsy people, but I haven't really had much experience with this and already have a massive phobia about bugs. Every black speck, every hair brushing against me, every little think I used when I was visiting my brothers house I'm having trouble using again thinking there's something on there. I need some kind of help because I cannot live like this

,Anxiety,"Hi guys!

I’ve been using journaling for the past 7-8 months to calm my anxiety. I find that when my mind is just exploding with racing thoughts and I’m not able to calm down with my normal wind-down routine (breathing, no phone etc.) - journaling is that one thing that makes my mind shut up and I’m able to relax again.

It took me a few months to get the hang of it. When I was starting out, journaling felt so overwhelming because I didnt know What to journal or how to approach it. So I bought some journals that had the same questions every day that focuses on gratitude. It definitely made me more grateful, but that wasnt really my goal. And I got bored of answering the same questions every single day.

The best way to approach it turned out to be just journaling whatever was on my mind, and when I was struggling to find my thoughts, I would use a prompt from the internet like: «I feel the most calm when I...»
That really helped. 
Recipe = whatever on my mind/be inspired by a prompt. 

So for christmas presents this year, I want to gift my loved ones peace of mind. I am planning on making all my friends and family a journal that is like this:

- An introduction to journaling, and why it is effective at calming the mind, the science behind it, and famous people that journal (motivating them to try it out)

- 90 Pages for 90 days of journaling (including Different writing prompts for each day if your struggling with writing)

,Anxiety,"Hello everyone,

47 days ago on a weekend I had casual penetrative vaginal sex with two women at different times. I used condoms both times and when I finished we made sure that it was in good condition, it didn’t break or something like that, but i didn’t fill it with water to make sure, i never do.

 I made oral sex to one of them and I fingered both of them, I bite my nails maybe this put me in risk, but doctors told me is very very low risk.

But 17 days after those encounters I felt feverish (99.4 F Armpit Temperature), i had fatigue (I stayed in bed for a few hours), i had a headache (strong) and muscle pain, but these symptoms lasted 1 day and a half, maybe two days max. Now i feel good and i don’t have any symptoms! Yesterday I noticed a little bump on my armpit, maybe it a swollen node i don’t know. Oh! It was not COVID what happened because I tested negative.

&amp;#x200B;

I called an HIV/STD organization in my city and I explained my case to them and they told me to be calm, that there is nothing to worry about! But I don’t usually get sick so I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

NEXT Tuesday on *December 1* (**World AIDS/HIV Day**, what a coincidence, right?), I have an appointment for a HIV *4th Generation* Exam at the hospital in city in Madrid (Europe). I waited this long so I have a good window period. I will receive the results after 5-6 days, so i will have to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid but I have to be strong, the wisest thing is to take the exam. I can't sleep well at night, I regret my actions. I know there is no cure but with the new advances in medicine it is possible to live a decent and healthy life. Getting tested is the greatest act of self-love that i can do to myself. I know I will be fine, public health care is good in Spain and I know that my family will never abandon me.

I’m fairly new to Reddit so forgive me if I format anything incorrectly. So the last few weeks I’ve been getting really nauseous and have been feeling absolutely horrible.

,Anxiety,"So me (M20) and this girl (F18) met up and hung out as friends around late September. It was fun and she texted back after saying she had a good time. I asked her to hangout a few more times during October and she was busy. I was getting the vibe that maybe she didn't wanna be my friend or was truly busy. I tend to overthink things so idk.

Last week she texted me for plans which surprised me. She said ""hey! do you ever wanna go to barnes and nobles and look for manga sometime? I’ve actually never been in that section before and I’ve always wanted to look around"" Its something we talked about so ik the text was meant for me. I responded saying ""Yah for sure! Im busy Saturday but totally free Sunday."" I never get a response so Sunday I text her again saying ""Hey! Are you free anytime this week? lmk."" No response. Yesterday she posts a snapchat of her at the store so I guess she ended up going without me.

Its been a week and she hasn't texted. I seriously don't know what I should say to her now. I hate being the clingy person that texts three times in a row. I think she wants to be friends since she's the one that texted me for plans but kinda confused why she went without me and never responded. Definitely not annoyed by me since she texts me for convo sometimes.

One of my girl friends from back home said maybe she thinks I'm pursuing her romantically and that she's shy to meet-up again or doesn't wanna let me down.

It was fun and she texted back after saying she had a good time. I asked her to hangout a few more times during October and she was busy. I was getting the vibe that maybe she didn&amp;#39;t wanna be my friend or was truly busy. I tend to overthink things so idk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week she texted me for plans which surprised me. She said &amp;quot;hey! do you ever wanna go to barnes and nobles and look for manga sometime? I’ve actually never been in that section before and I’ve always wanted to look around&amp;quot; Its something we talked about so ik the text was meant for me. I responded saying &amp;quot;Yah for sure! Im busy Saturday but totally free Sunday.&amp;quot; I never get a response so Sunday I text her again saying &amp;quot;Hey! Are you free anytime this week? lmk.&amp;quot; No response. Yesterday she posts a snapchat of her at the store so I guess she ended up going without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its been a week and she hasn&amp;#39;t texted. I seriously don&amp;#39;t know what I should say to her now. I hate being the clingy person that texts three times in a row. I think she wants to be friends since she&amp;#39;s the one that texted me for plans but kinda confused why she went without me and never responded. Definitely not annoyed by me since she texts me for convo sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my girl friends from back home said maybe she thinks I&amp;#39;m pursuing her romantically and that she&amp;#39;s shy to meet-up again or doesn&amp;#39;t wanna let me down. I definitely get vibes that she&amp;#39;s shy or introverted because she talked about how her only friends are online.

,Anxiety,"Recently my family visited my brother's home with our dog and unfortunately came across ticks. My dog wears a small shirt and we saw one (a nymph) crawling on her shirt. We took it off and checked her but didn't find anything. I am someone with very extreme anxiety about ticks. I have bad anxiety in general but ticks are something that scare me so bad. 

Fast forward to last night when I was in my brother's home and found another nymph crawling along my blanket. Immediately I was freaking out. I felt like they were just all over me at that point. We left early to come home from our trip because of it and I got a shower immediately. I checked my body for anything and didn't find anything, but am still worried about something being in my hair. 

We bathed our dog and unfortunately found two ticks on her. Another nymph and one that sort of looked like it had been feeding for a bit, both at the same entrypoint. I stepped up and was the one to remove them, but have been feeling sick and lightheaded since this whole thing started and it's taken a lot out of me to calm myself down to the point where I don't faint. I've felt like I was on the verge of it for a couple times now.

Here is where I need the advice. I am freaking out thinking they're on me now. On our things. On my dog even more than what we found. Are they going to fall off and attach on us in the home?  Are they going to lay eggs inside our house and cause an infestation? Can they crawl from my dog and go on us instead??

These questions have been running through my mind all night long. It may seem like such an overreaction but they are something that have really scared me for most of my life. I havent been able to get any sleep and I'm scratching my body so much that I've begun to practically give myself marks from how hard I'm just panicing and itching THINKING that somethings on me. I also had lice as a kid and that's traumatized me to these small pests that I'm just freaking out.

I've cross posted this on thr r/DogAdvice subreddit to get more help for my dog on her side, but here I think I need more help for myself. I haven't been able to calm myself down since this happened and know ticks aren't a big deal to hunters and more woodsy people, but I haven't really had much experience with this and already have a massive phobia about bugs. Every black speck, every hair brushing against me, every little think I used when I was visiting my brothers house I'm having trouble using again thinking there's something on there.

Anyway, I had another episode on Saturday and the stress of dealing with it (even though there's nothing I can do) has meant that absolutely nothing has happened all weekend. I've just been in bed, essentially for 48 hours, taking pictures of the reaction to send to my doctor and stressing myself to hell and back thinking about what could be causing it and if I'm going to have another episode (antihistamines have not been helpful and the reaction seems to be getting progressively worse).

,Anxiety,"Hi guys!

I’ve been using journaling for the past 7-8 months to calm my anxiety. I find that when my mind is just exploding with racing thoughts and I’m not able to calm down with my normal wind-down routine (breathing, no phone etc.) - journaling is that one thing that makes my mind shut up and I’m able to relax again.

It took me a few months to get the hang of it. When I was starting out, journaling felt so overwhelming because I didnt know What to journal or how to approach it. So I bought some journals that had the same questions every day that focuses on gratitude. It definitely made me more grateful, but that wasnt really my goal. And I got bored of answering the same questions every single day.

The best way to approach it turned out to be just journaling whatever was on my mind, and when I was struggling to find my thoughts, I would use a prompt from the internet like: «I feel the most calm when I...»
That really helped. 
Recipe = whatever on my mind/be inspired by a prompt. 

So for christmas presents this year, I want to gift my loved ones peace of mind. I am planning on making all my friends and family a journal that is like this:

- An introduction to journaling, and why it is effective at calming the mind, the science behind it, and famous people that journal (motivating them to try it out)

- 90 Pages for 90 days of journaling (including Different writing prompts for each day if your struggling with writing)

,Anxiety,"Hi all, 

I’m feeling very anxious and strange right now. I think I know why, I’m absolutely exhausted. I’ve been battling anxiety for the past 10 or so years just for background. 

My dog had a litter of puppies Friday night, we (my partner and I) thought she was going in to labour on Thursday night, so we didn’t sleep very well Thursday. 
Then all Friday morning I was really anxious, I was worried about my dog and whether she’d be okay, and whether the pups would all be okay. 

She finished giving birth around 11pm on Friday, with minor complications during the birth and a scare at one point when she started bleeding quite a bit after I had to pull a puppy out of her that was stuck. I’m happy to say that she’s well now and has settled in to being a mum nicely! 

On Friday I got to bed about 4am, after letting my partner get some sleep, and then was up after about 2 hours - we can’t let the dog or pups out of our sight at the moment as she may sit on one etc and we need to be there to chaperone.

Saturday I wasn’t too bad, was exhausted, emotionally and physically, but I managed to get a cat nap in at lunch time and my partner and I took it in turns watching her all night, getting little 2 hour sleeps in each and then swapping. 

Today I just feel awful. I feel so exhausted, the most tired I have ever felt in my life, and when I’m tired it usually makes my anxiety a lot worse, or at least it’s a lot harder to reassure myself that I’ll be okay. The exhaustion is really hard for me, I feel so strange, physically and mentally. The past 3 days have blurred in to one and I’m starting to struggle. 

Sorry to rant - I feel like I just need some reassurance that things will get easier soon and that I will be able to cope, I really don’t want to let my partner down and I really want to start feeling more in control. I can deal with the anxiety usually, it just feels hopeless today, like there’s no escape from it and like everything’s not going to be okay. 

TL;DR - dog had puppies Friday night and haven’t slept very much in the past 3 days, or the sleep has been very disturbed, and it’s making me feel like my anxiety has got the better of me.

,Anxiety,"I sometimes get into these manic anxiety attacks that last for hours when I am alone. Usually I am very irritable a few days before and after.

This happened yesterday and I get this dizziness and pressure in my ears while feeling severe paranoia. I usually soothe myself by rubbing my forearms, pacing and even rocking my body back in forth (similar to self stimulation for autistic individuals).

I also when I get really mad and dizzy sometimes just want to bang my head on something, just to get out of my own thoughts.

I almost feel like I want to yell for help but that's such a low thing to do but doing these things for attention but I don't know.

These episodes have been happening a lot more often during covid since I am alone sometimes for the whole day. Last time I had some weed to calm down and that really helped but I don't know if it's a good idea to abuse it like that. 

Like I said, I know I need to see someone. My insurance changed on Jan 1st and I get alot better options then so I have been pushing things off but this has been affecting my relationships because I've been being a real dick the past few days with snide comments and such but I feel such a malaise and I'm so irritated with everything.

,Anxiety,"Earlier this year I developed a terrible insomnia that lasted a few weeks and was crippling, at exactly the same time I started therapy. It eventually passed, but ever since I have issues sleeping for maybe one night a week. I'm mostly pretty used to it by now and don't stress too much unless it's more than one night a week bc it makes me anxious if I'm constantly tired. However since a bit before Thanksgiving I've started not being able to sleep for more than 7 hours a night, and the last two nights I've been waking up every half hour for almost the entire night (at least at some point yesterday it stopped and I slept straight through, at the moment I'm taking a break from trying to make myself sleep to make this post so I don't know if it'll go the same way yet).

I know I have trauma related to the holidays from growing up with someone extremely emotionally and verbally abusive who was INSANELY controlling about the holidays. I no longer speak to this person, but about once a year she still tries to reach out around this time and demand to come visit even though she's been cut out just to rock the boat and make everybody miserable. Thankfully this year I already know that she's too afraid of the current global health situation to try and pull anything, but I've been talking to my therapist a lot about the concept of ""physical memories"" and how my body was evolved specifically to remember traumatic events for survival purposes. Meaning that even if I don't consciously remember trauma, my body does and is likely to react with fear. So, naturally, despite being completely safe and happy, I'm struggling with anxiety, and thus my insomnia is back.

My point in making this post is just to vent, I guess, and to ask for reassurance that this is gonna pass. My insomnia last time went away, and I'm sure it will this time too. But it's scary and it would help me a lot to hear kind words from outside my own head.

,Anxiety,"Hi there,
I don‘t know if this is the right place to post this. But I’ve been wondering for quite some time now if there are other people out there, having similar problems as me. So here goes:

I am scared shitless of taking up a job, internship, or virtually any sort of productive activity. There is no bigger dread to me than thinking of my inadequacy for the most basic tasks. I get overwhelmed whenever I imagine the tasks I may be confronted with and the various ways in which I could mess up / sth could wrong.
I didn’t have to confront this fundamental fear of mine in the past because my parents were incredibly generous and have supported me for all these years (I’m 20 years old now) - and I greatly appreciate that, I really do. But I feel increasingly guilty for not addressing this issue, esp. because I haven’t made any progress at all. 
The thing is, I wouldn’t even call myself lazy. Whenever I have to do something, I work hard toward succeeding at this task. And oddly enough, I love learning/ studying. I really do. So it doesn’t disturb that this often means putting in a lot of effort. But as soon as it is about the practical application of whatever I’ve learnt, I’m literally paralyzed by fear and can’t think of anything else.

Facing your fears is AMAZING (actually, the BEST!). Going to therapy/counselling is also amazing (if you can access it). These are all GREAT coping mechanisms for your tool box!

That being said, if you've never tried, please do **self-directed CBT** (abundance resources on google - **""CBT worksheets""**). It is recommended to do an hour session once a week for 12-20 weeks. Keep those tools you learn in your self-directed therapy with you throughout your day and *practice, practice, practice*. 

CBT is evidence-based and used to treat a broad range of psychiatric disorders. It has a success rate of 75%+ or higher (and that's just within 12-20 weeks!). 

Remember, you are not in control of your thoughts (we think 1.6 thoughts/second, 99% of them are meaningless). You are in control of your REACTION and your ATTITUDE towards your thoughts. Another tool I use to ask myself: ""Who would I be without this worry?""

I’ve also always been an anxious person, but by and large I’ve been able to manage anxiety for the past through years through a combination of mindfulness, exercise and lexapro.

However, I am prone to putting off certain tasks for as long as possible, even when in theory they are tasks I should enjoy doing. I’ve never really been able to understand this part of my own brain until recently.

The hardest part of being productive, for me, is sitting down with a problem I have no idea how to address and figuring out how to manage it.

,Anxiety,"Hi, thank you for reading this.
like so many young adults, getting a job is one of the biggest challenges in your life. Every since I was 17 I sought after a job and always come out flat. I applied for a movie theater and the employees told me to go home and expect a phone call. I never got it. (Well maybe I did and was just too anxious to answer it? I don’t know) By my 19th birthday my dad took me to a fast food joint. It was my first interview and I was hired on the spot, but I was told to wait for a phone call and they never called me back. Than I try several grocery stores, the last was an hour and a half away from my house and after several interviews the people told me to wait for a phone call. Guess what? No phone call.

After that episode I decided to try out some stay at home jobs like  blogging and freelance writing but they didn’t turn out as I expected. I watched hours of YouTube videos with thumbnails telling me I can make hundreds of dollars a day doing nothing and they were all big lies. I even try to work with my fathers business at home but the only position he had for me was supervising his social media accounts which was boring.

Finally I decided I’ll do twitch streaming but I needed to wait all year to get a good functioning computer and microphone. after much hesitation, I put in under 10 hours of gameplay on the site and made The discovery that streaming just wasn’t for me.

I was really upset, all of that wait and complaining was for nothing. “Where do I go from here?” I asked myself. How do I support myself while also pursuing my dream of becoming a bestselling writer?

My parents assured me not to worry too much, they’ll support me with whatever job I can find and that they won’t kick me out of their home or anything like that. however, they did highly recommend that I get something worth a good resumé like being a waiter or going to college for a higher education and those things I’m not interested, especially since I’m kind of a introvert.

,Anxiety,"(TW: Mention of suicidality)

I just had an epiphany, thanks to someone who messaged me after I posted to r/SuicideWatch.

My traumatic infancy (fraught with uncontrollability and unpredictability) set the stage for my GAD, and at the heart of that has always been my absolutely desperate need for control. I think that this need goes deeper than I realized. Because now that I think of it, the majority of my maladaptive responses to things are *all about control.*

Right now, there are so many things in my life that I can't control. I am used to panic attacks and physiological anxiety, but I realize now that even my suicidal feelings and impulses come from that control aspect. First, if I can't control an outside thing/person, then at least I can control my life and pain (hence self-harm); and second, I don't want to escape life, I just want to escape the crippling anxiety (masked in anger, sadness, depression, etc.) that is caused by not being able to control everything. Everything that triggers me, everything that is making me so high-strung and dysregulated and unstable and driving my emotions mad, comes down to not being able to control.

I also realize that I have a pattern of letting things beyond my control, control ME. Instead of taking ownership of the things I *can* control, I allow things I *can't* control to define and command my emotions. For years I did this with self-worth: I still hate that I can't control others' opinions of me (i.e. that people can dislike me even if I didn't do anything ""wrong"" or it was a misunderstanding, and I can't change their mind), but I used to therefore allow others' opinions define how I felt about myself. Why? Because I am obsessed with having control. Control is safety and security. Control used to be the difference between life and death--and lack of control was a threat to my life.

Ultimately, my problem is not being able to find happiness when I can't have control, and/or struggling to find smaller things I *can* control even when I can't make everything picture-perfect. I don't know how to be happy or content if there is something in my life that makes me unhappy and I know I'm powerless to change. I'm a rigid thinker, and I have trouble seeing that I could still be happy if I adjusted my perception of a situation, or the importance I assign something, or my expectations. In a workplace capacity, I'm a very creative and flexible thinker and problem-solver. When it comes to my mental health, not at all. Objectively, I know I can either accept that I can't control it (monumentally easier said than done) or leave the situation altogether (also monumentally easier said than done, sometimes). Subjectively, it's hell.

I don't know, I just felt like sharing this. Perhaps it can offer perspective to anyone else here with comorbid issues.

,Anxiety,"Howdy,

I suffer from C-PTSD comorbid Agoraphobia with Panic Disorder. I also have an intense fear of vomiting. I relapsed into agoraphobia while going through a divorce during the pandemic (that I'm still going through as of this date).

Also, although not an official diagnosis, I strongly believe I suffer/suffered from Post Infidelity Stress Disorder, which is due to being cheated on, gaslit, manipulated and so on (which I've managed to mostly recover from as of this date).

The first two weeks after the divorce decision was made, I could not be alone and my partner took off work for two weeks to stay at home with me. Two months later and I'm able to be at home alone just fine, and I'm able to drive within a few miles of my home.

Specifically, I'm here for medication advice. My doctor tried Paxil at a very low dose last June (which I only took 1/4th of the minimum therapeutic dose). I had night sweats, night terrors, and extreme anxiety on this medication; along with seething rage. We tapered off slowly and I tried CBD for a few weeks with little noticeable impact.

Sidenote, weed just causes me to immediately go into a panic attack (but didn't used to, but I wasn't agoraphobic last December).

I've started Lexapro two nights ago at half the minimum dosage. I'm nauseous constantly and I experienced a panic attack at home like I haven't experienced for months last night. My head feels buzzy and I'm more anxious on this medication.

However, I have started to try using Xanax, which I've had since 2016 and only took once up to this point. I have an rx for 0.5mg and I'm finding 1/4th of a pill is enough to knock out my anxiety so it's tolerable (even last night when it was severe), 0.125mg.

While I know that continued exposure therapy, meditation, good diet and exercise will eventually dig myself out of this hole, considering last time I relapsed it took me two years to get out... what are some other medications I can suggest to my doctor to try? I get that I need to be gentle and understanding with myself, but I'm becoming irritated because I was traveling to Key West, flying across the country just last year and now I'm lucky to be a block away from home.

As useful as I've found Benzos, I'm really reluctant to take them period due to the tolerance and dependency profile.

Am I just super sensitive to medication and need to try an even lower dosage of Lexapro? Do I just need to tough out an SSRI until I know what it's like after 4-6 weeks? What about a beta blocker? I also have slightly high blood sugar and blood pressure.

I'm going to start looking for a good cognitive behavioral therapist come Monday. I was just getting started with an EMDR therapist before the pandemic hit, but they've stopped all visits due to the pandemic. I was using Betterhelp up to just recently.. but didn't find much value in it.

,Anxiety,"Hi guys, I visit r/ADHD a lot because it’s my main diagnosis but I wanted to get some insight on how you guys deals with chronic overwhelm (TL;DR at bottom because this is a longer post). I’m diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive type and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in my teenage years. My psych evals from elementary school diagnosed me with “ADHD with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and preoccupation with worry”. I am take medication for my ADHD (Vyvanse 40mg daily) but have never been medicated for anxiety. I have been in long-term therapy for the last year and a half. Due to some of my past struggles with job/school performance, my anxiety mostly occurs when it’s related to “what I need to do/should be doing”. 

I use a bullet journal to keep a list of the things I need to do on a daily/monthly/someday-in-the-future basis. It helps me stay organized but it also puts me in a chronic state of overwhelm. I constantly reflect on how much I want to do in life and I feel like I’m always behind. My ADHD makes it difficult to start even short-term tasks so my long-term tasks usually end up getting put on the back burner. When I am able to start a task, my perfectionist tendencies make it difficult to finish them in any reasonable amount of time. So a month will go by and I’ll look back on my monthly “future goal” list and I just get completely overwhelmed because 75-85% of my monthly goals didn’t get done. 

I know there are a lot of factors here, some of it is probably me being too ambitious with my goals and not being realistic about the free time I have. On the other hand, I know I get easily distracted and I can throw away 4 hours no problem. Whether it’s with obvious time-wasters like video games, or “seemingly productive” tasks like writing the perfect email to a client. Either way, the results are the same in that I spend almost 100% of my day worrying and ruminating about what “should be doing”. These thoughts are conscious and I’m cognizant of them even while I’m engaging in a time-wasting activity watching (playing around on phone, Netflix, etc.). And because I take longer than the average person to complete basic tasks, my day usually ends with me berating myself for not doing what I set out to do. For example, I wanted to cook dinner tonight. I told myself all day I would cook. I played video games and played around on my phone while telling myself I needed to cook dinner for hours and never ended up making it. That is a typical day for me. Ruminating about doing a task while (seemingly) compulsively engaging in a time-waster, which ultimately leads to unhappiness and stress while doing the time-waster, leading to even more overwhelm, as well as regret and guilt/shame. Not very productive! 

I’m working on a lot of this in therapy which helps. Most of what we work on is behavioral and incorporating good habits i.e. good sleep, daily exercise, wait healthy, etc. which have all gotten better. I just can’t shake the constant feeling of chronic overwhelm and feeling like I’m always behind in my day-to-day and with my future goals. As I said before, I visit r/ADHD a lot but haven’t visited this subreddit very often and I’m just hoping to get some insight. Do you guys experience anxiety in this way as well? What have you guys found that helps with coping with these feelings? I’ve never been on anxiety meds but sometimes (more often than not) the overwhelm is so strong that it’s paralyzing. Any feedback or insight is appreciated 😌

TL;DR- ADHDer in therapy and chronically overwhelmed, mostly by seeing my “to-do” lists, to the point where it becomes paralyzing and I will waste time while simultaneously ruminating about the tasks that I should be doing instead.

I’m diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive type and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in my teenage years. My psych evals from elementary school diagnosed me with “ADHD with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and preoccupation with worry”. I am take medication for my ADHD (Vyvanse 40mg daily) but have never been medicated for anxiety. I have been in long-term therapy for the last year and a half. Due to some of my past struggles with job/school performance, my anxiety mostly occurs when it’s related to “what I need to do/should be doing”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a bullet journal to keep a list of the things I need to do on a daily/monthly/someday-in-the-future basis. It helps me stay organized but it also puts me in a chronic state of overwhelm. I constantly reflect on how much I want to do in life and I feel like I’m always behind. My ADHD makes it difficult to start even short-term tasks so my long-term tasks usually end up getting put on the back burner. When I am able to start a task, my perfectionist tendencies make it difficult to finish them in any reasonable amount of time. So a month will go by and I’ll look back on my monthly “future goal” list and I just get completely overwhelmed because 75-85% of my monthly goals didn’t get done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are a lot of factors here, some of it is probably me being too ambitious with my goals and not being realistic about the free time I have. On the other hand, I know I get easily distracted and I can throw away 4 hours no problem. Whether it’s with obvious time-wasters like video games, or “seemingly productive” tasks like writing the perfect email to a client. Either way, the results are the same in that I spend almost 100% of my day worrying and ruminating about what “should be doing”. These thoughts are conscious and I’m cognizant of them even while I’m engaging in a time-wasting activity watching (playing around on phone, Netflix, etc.). And because I take longer than the average person to complete basic tasks, my day usually ends with me berating myself for not doing what I set out to do. For example, I wanted to cook dinner tonight. I told myself all day I would cook. I played video games and played around on my phone while telling myself I needed to cook dinner for hours and never ended up making it. That is a typical day for me. Ruminating about doing a task while (seemingly) compulsively engaging in a time-waster, which ultimately leads to unhappiness and stress while doing the time-waster, leading to even more overwhelm, as well as regret and guilt/shame. Not very productive! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a lot of this in therapy which helps. Most of what we work on is behavioral and incorporating good habits i.e. good sleep, daily exercise, wait healthy, etc. which have all gotten better. I just can’t shake the constant feeling of chronic overwhelm and feeling like I’m always behind in my day-to-day and with my future goals. As I said before, I visit &lt;a href=""/r/ADHD""&gt;r/ADHD&lt;/a&gt; a lot but haven’t visited this subreddit very often and I’m just hoping to get some insight. Do you guys experience anxiety in this way as well? What have you guys found that helps with coping with these feelings? I’ve never been on anxiety meds but sometimes (more often than not) the overwhelm is so strong that it’s paralyzing. Any feedback or insight is appreciated 😌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR- ADHDer in therapy and chronically overwhelmed, mostly by seeing my “to-do” lists, to the point where it becomes paralyzing and I will waste time while simultaneously ruminating about the tasks that I should be doing instead. Looking for advice on how to cope with these feelings and not be as hard on myself for not having all of my “to-do’s” done. Interested in how medication has or hasn’t helped you guys with chronic overwhelm and if so which medications you found helpful (and not helpful).&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"As of Feburary of this year I started getting anxious and I’ve it’s stopped me from having a positive social life. I’m glad it’s been during COVID and not any other year because I’ve spent most of this year in my home anyways. 

I’m wondering if this has anything to do with it but since 2019, I’ve lost a bit of weight (nothing concerning) from being out of college and eating healthier. I was 175 in college at 5’11 and now I float around 165-167 depending on the day. I’ve lost a bit of muscle since I stopped working out and now I put all my time to music. I spend a lot of my time inside writing and practicing and when it comes to going to social situations I get nervous because of my introvertedness. 

I can’t ride in Uber’s anymore because I feel trapped and can’t get to a bathroom, I especially can’t ride them with people because it makes me feel claustrophobic. 

Whether I’m going 5 minutes down the road or 20 minutes down the road it’s just too long for me. My body instantly goes into fight or flight mode, my inner body has a panic attack and I immediately feel like I need to use the restroom or else I will pee myself. And my biggest fear in life is peeing myself or pooping myself around friends. 

I have been given medication that cuts off my need to urinate and I can take it with alcohol but it still just isn’t good to always be on. I’ve taken my friends anxiety medication before and I feel back to normal but when I’m not on anything it’s tough for me to be locked away in a car and feel trapped. Even if I went to a bar and had 1 beer and went to the bathroom before I left, I’d still get that feeling in the car.

It sounds silly, but I miss the days where I use to be able to be drunk and hold it and never have to worry about any of this happening and now I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to go on stage again due to this feeling. I only feel normal when I’m at home or in the car with parents. Otherwise I’m always on my medication. 

What do I do? Has anyone experienced anything similar?


TL:DR I get terrible anxiety, claustrophobia, and panic attacks when I’m out of my comfort zone and in social situations that keeps me from enjoying what I use to never having a problem doing and it makes me need to pee instantly from fight or flight mode.

I went to eat at Thanksgiving and when I sat down and was about to eat, I lost my appetite and felt nauseous. It was weird because I ate something prior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days later I feel better but still have nausea that comes and goes. I am eating plain stuff like oatmeal, apples, and drinking ginger tea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember having something like this last year around April-May before COVID. I felt off and on nausea for a week or so until it went away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t really been anywhere since COVID is widespread where I live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever had this before? I don’t feel particularly anxious but I know anxiety can have crazy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

What are yours?

Music: I started a new online music training, helping me to read scores, train my ears &amp; improve my piano skills. My brain needs new daily input, and for me, music training does the trick (at least, for a big part). It brings me in the here and now - beyond any meaningless mind-chatter talking me into anxiety &amp; depression. Even when I don't feel like - I commit to do this for at least 10 minutes - often I stay much longer.

Conscious relaxation: every morning &amp; every evening I do some specific breathing exercises, a bit of meditation, and a combination of yoga exercises. The things I practice do change however, the trick for me is to sense what my body needs. Since I'm practicing already +20 years, I have a lot to choose from. 

Nature: I go for daily walks in a nearby park, and I consciously connect with the sounds of the birds and the beauty of the trees. Even when it's raining or whatever: I learn not to judge and just observe. Just doing this helps me to build more resilience, day by day. I never force myself, and whenever I feel I'm making this habit too mechanical, I slow down and take another path, visit another park, look at another tree. This is not about becoming airy-fairy, it's grounding, here &amp; now. 

Oh yes, at home I often (understatement) listen to [these relaxing ocean sounds (this playlist)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4bzeXolqeEd12KrkDeqNng?si=NsYANkZnTJOKTSIkQDFYMw).

,Anxiety,"Last year I felt like my life was out of control. It seemed like everything I had tried to do to ""fix"" my situation had only added more stress to my life. I could see the whole cycle starting again. I knew that this time I would have to dig in and understand myself in a way that I never had before. I read many great books that gave me the language and the framework to interpret my experiences. I learned breath awareness techniques and began to strengthen my ability to sit with uncomfort without fleeing or fixing it. These techniques and knowledge were amazing, but the biggest help by far came from the care and support of a handful of local teachers in my area.

One group was called Satsang, a hindu tradition that focuses on learning to sit with the physical sensations that come up when we begin to get hijacked by stories. 

The other was a group that met everyday called AWE (Are We Engaging) which emphasized connecting with your authentic self over your preprogrammed self. AWE super accelerated my growth because we were very direct in our self examinations. Other group members could ask you questions and post observations (with consent of course). You were expected to bring your best and possibly answer some difficult questions in areas you might not have looked into in a long time. 

These groups took me in a new direction at a key time in my life and I am very grateful for those experiences. Meds, psychiatrists and pay-by-the-hour counselors are well and great, but there is nothing that can compare to mutual engagement with a real person.   


The surface experience of our lives is a reflection of our actions. All actions are driven by emotion. Emotions are generated by relationships, with ourselves, with others, both consummated and absent.

Every belief that shapes our current world model can be traced back to a specific experience at a specific time with a specific person - in short: a memory. 

It's not so important that we ""fix"" ourselves or change something in the world. Turn the mirror inside out. Once we begin to understand who *we* are and why we do things the exterior world begins to change on it's own.

however the issue lies with my social anxiety. he keeps asking me to join his xbox live with a few of his other friends which scares the hell out of me. even calling him alone can sometimes be a struggle on my part due to my anxiety so the thought of talking to other people i have never met is terrifying. i feel terrible making a promise to him that i’d play when i full know that might not be a promise i can keep which is fault on my part.

,Anxiety," Hi all, I recently discovered that I have a really bad tendency to get anxious when I feel as if I'm being left out of stuff, even when I can't make it in the first place. For example, this week I went home for the weekend (I'm in college) for a job interview. While I was home, my friends hung out without me and went out. After hearing about this and seeing it on social media I started to get very anxious to the point that it was uncomfortable and I became pretty upset. Even though I couldn't go with them in the first place, I was sad. This kind of feeling has been getting progressively more common for me over the last year, especially during the quarantine and through starting college. I believe there are a few factors behind it.

First, one of my friends in my friend group and I haven't been getting along very well, even though we used to get along great in high school. This has really thrown me through a loop and he occasionally hangs out with another one of our friends without me. Despite this being their business, not mine, I still get a little upset when I feel like I'm being left out. Second, I think my real fear is that my friends will start intentionally leaving me out of things because they don't want to be around me as much.

I believe this is a case of FOMO. If so, could anyone help me out with ways to feel better when stuff like this happens? I don't want to feel anxious when I have no reason to.

,Anxiety,"Hey guys!

I am super new here and asking for a help. I would be so grateful for whoever can answer my questions. 

Here’s my story: for around 4 years Ive been having mainly huge abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation. I’ve done tons of tests and endo/colonoscopy but had nothing diagnosed. Also have done a couple of things (stopping alcohol + reducing sugar) but nothing made it gone (better but not that much). I’ve always been a stressed person and always having health problems, but in the last couple of years it’s unbearable. 
Alongside my GI problems, i can’t seem to relax. My sleep is very bad, problems breathing, random headaches, very sensitive and bad memory and a very weird thing is happing to me: whenever I hear anything i get afraid and my belly stresses out. Also when my GF touches me (without knowing) my abdominal stresses out. 
There’s a ton of other things, but my questions are the following:

1) Is that anxiety 😫? Could my whole GI problems be causes by anxiety and only anxiety ? Tbh i truly don’t know whats anxiety at the first place and how it feels 😞. 

2) what would you recommend if you were in my case ? I am 27 years old btw

3) do you think my gut is causing me my anxiety or the anxiety is making my gut upset all the time.

I have been sitting here procrastinating for hours. It sounds stupid, but its like im scared to walk down the hall and take a shower, and its only worse now its the middle of the night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never experienced this over showering before. My fear comes from the fact that I live in a country where sometimes the electricity cuts out for a while unexpectedly. Over the years, since childhood, this has happened many times when I have been in the shower. Sitting on the floor of the shower in the total dark, screaming for someone to help me because I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting the light to go out and I couldn&amp;#39;t get out without slipping or falling in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just need someone to talk me through it I guess. I&amp;#39;m still sitting here now. Its a simple thing but can someone just give me like a lost of what I should do when I go take a shower. I know the lights will stay on but I still feel anxious about them going off.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hi everyone.  Apologizes in advance for mobile formatting. 

This is a throw away account but I'm in desperate need of help. 

I have a boyfriend.  We've been together for almost 2 years, we've known each other for 3. We are currently in a long distance relationship, and until now, we've been good at it. We wont be together in person until Feburary.  

Recently, my anxiety has been out of control (I've been diagnosed with depression and a panic disorder since I was 16 and I'm currently 35). I've never had a lot of anxiety when it comes to him. I know that he loves me. But now my anxiety is making me an irrational girlfriend.  

For example, the new World of Warcraft expansion recently came out.  Due to a misunderstanding, he has devoted all his gaming time to other friends, instead of to the characters we've always played together. And we've been playing WoW together since shortly after we discovered it was a mutual interest.  I view that game as ""our thing"" and I feel like I've lost that now. 

The super fucked up thing is that now every time he plays that game, I get irrationally mad and super anxious. He's offered to tell his other friends that he can't play with them, but I feel that's stupid and I've encouraged him not to do that.  It's just a game and he should be able to play it how he wants to, and not have me freak out over it. To compound all of this, he recently got a job, so our time together is already dwindling, as now we have to work around our work schedules. 

I know it would be better if we weren't long distance. But I feel like, right now, all we have is our time together when we're in Discord or playing a game together.  

I plan to restart therapy in January (I dont have benefits until then because I had to wait for open enrollment), but I need help in the meantime. 

This relationship anxiety is spilling into every other facet of my life. It's raised my general anxiety and I can't eat at all, nor am I sleeping well. I'm basically obsessing over this. 

I feel ridiculous over being anxious about a video game. I know it's irrational and silly, but as many of you know, we can't choose what our anxiety goes crazy over.

Recently with guidance from my psychiatrist I've been slowly getting off risperdal.

I was down to 1mg and a half but I just ran out. And my pharmacy doesn't have 1mg.

Anyways, I've been without risperdal for maybe 4 days.

I don't know, but I feel like I'm high but not a good high.

I feel kind of funky. As if like, a sense of doom or something. I''ve also been running every week.

I don't know, I just feel kind of weird. A sense of uneasy.

I just really want to stop taking this drug. What if I just stop? I'm sick of the weight gain from risperdal. What if I just stop?

You can't die from risperdal withdrawal. Will I start to feel better soon?

,Anxiety,"Hope you all are coping well :)

Lately i have lost my appetite, and the gerd comes the worst of it. Most times i feel nauseous. This week has been the worst bcs I get frequent headaches and shallow breaths. It feels even worst bcs this week is actually my leisure week when i have no deadlines, i could and should have been just chilling. But idk why my body feels like i have to cope with something.

When i got a slight inconvenience, i started to feel pounding in my head, and then i started to notice that every time i take a breath, it never felt like my lung is fulfilled. I have experienced this a little while ago when i lost my father. My family and i know nothing about anxiety back then (or even now), and it got so bad that everytime im breathing, my chest hurt. so i just asked to be checked by a general doctor and she said there’s nothing wrong with me, and it made me feel like a delusional weirdo.

I tried to be active and exercise to overcome this. I felt better for several hours, but then the headache always coming back. This has always happened everytime i have a high intensity training. My sister suggest to take b complex vitamin and today i bought it! Hopefully it will help.

I also not sure whether this has something to do with caffeine. The other day i tried to cut it off, but somehow the headache and breathing problem is still there. Maybe im not cutting it off long enough? But it’s hard when im doing online classes, and idk if it’s bcs im lazy or what, but most times i feel sleepy and need caffeine to kickstart my day. I guess i have a love and hate relationship with coffee, and today i had a big one, i just hope i can go to sleep.

I am trying my best to be happy and content with my life. In fact, i felt happy today bcs i spent a quality time with my family, but the inconvenient feeling of anxiety is always there. It makes me sad bcs it’s hard to be in the moment when as simple as breathing feels like an effort.

Based on past experience, i know ill get through this and things will get better. Im just hoping i can go to sleep now.

,Anxiety,"DAE experience swallowing anxiety with food and pills? 

This is my first time posting, but just wondering if anyone else experiences this. I’m not sure if this would be the correct thread or if the GERD one would be better. I’m really sorry if this sounds rambly, doesn’t make sense, or if this is the wrong place for it. It is something that’s driving me up the wall and making me feel a bit defeated at the moment. 

I have recently began seeing a psych for my troubles with anxiety/depression and  I am in the process of investigating my mental health overall (many years of symptoms, with no intervention until recently, so I have a scroll of traumatic events to work through). I was also recently diagnosed with GERD/acid reflux after suffering from a chronic cough for years.

I’ve seen connections made between the anxiety and GERD, but at this rate I feel like it is just my anxiety. I am waiting for an endoscopy to make sure nothing is physiologically wrong, but I am physically able to swallow.

When eating or taking pills, it’s like my brain and tongue block ANYTHING from going down my throat because it feels like I’m choking even before I swallow. I work myself into a state of panic (clammy hands, racing heart, throat constriction, dizziness, thoughts of choking and dying, etc.). Pills have been the most difficult, but it is becoming this way with food too. I also had teeth removed recently and have been struggling to swallow even soft or liquid things, like applesauce or soup, because of my fear. I sit with it in my mouth, but end up spitting it out or swallowing and feeling immediate anxiety This is hard because I can’t swallow the painkillers or antibiotics received after my extraction, so I empty the capsules onto applesauce (per my pharmacist) and try to consume them like that, but still can’t.

,Anxiety,"If you can offer advice, please please do

I am a teenager and am currently doing online school. For the last 3 weeks my anxiety has spiked up really bad. I have always had the whole thing, OCD, Social anxiety and just plain anxiety all wrapped in a package but it's never hit me like it has recently. My paranoia has been out of control, I feel like I'm dying and having a panic attack all the time. 

I wake up having a panic attack in the middle of the night or when I'm in that middle of sleep and wake. I wake up gasping for air like you would after a nightmare and my days are just as bad with the feeling of someone sitting on my stomach and that causes my throat to feel tight. My OCD makes repeatably wash my hands, in the past this was until they bleed but I'm trying to hold back. Right now I honestly want to have a mental breakdown every day, I can't sleep, I can't eat. And I know it's all in my head because I have these moments of clarity but I feel like I'm going insane. People keep telling me that I need to figure out what's causing the anxiety but for the love of God I dont know. All I know is that I'm miserable. For two days I found that taking night quil at night makes me eventually fall asleep, so I've been getting at least a few hours depending on the day, and sometimes I have to watch videos to distract me from trying to breath so I can eat. 

I can tell everyone in my house thinks I'm crazy. I've told them something was wrong with me and I needed to see a doctor. (I have prescribed anxiety meds) but the ones I have aren't working and my paranoia keeps telling me it's something more. There have been days when I doubted whether or not I was going to wake up. Not because I harmed myself but because my brain told me that is how sick I was. And I know that I'm stressing my mom and that she does care, but when she keeps asking me if im taking my medicine or has my step dad go secretly check to make sure, I feel so sad. Like don't you think I'm doing everything I can to make this awful feeling go away? And she will tell me to tell her about my anxiety but the truth is I shouldn't unless I have a therapist appointment because then she fusses because shes too worried about me to function but if I dont tell her the same thing applies. It's not her fault but I wish she realised that if I could just stop I would. I don't blame her for seeing me and saying for me to just stop but I wish I could!! I'm taking my meds, so it's better than if I wasn't but I'm still barely coping. I've been looking up online things to deal with anxiety but those have short term effects and don't help my panic attacks. I feel like it's all my fault and I know that it is, but I wish I could make the part in me doing it to stop. Half the time I'm hearing myself and I know I sound crazy but I need someone to tell me I'm crazy rn, but at the same time I need someone to believe me. Because although I know these things are inside my head they all feel so real. Its always been real but never this real.Sometimes I convince myself that I'm faking it, that I'm just doing it all just too do it, I know this also isn't true but sometimes I want it to be. I honestly don't know what I should do. I have a couple more days until my next appointment and I'm just surviving until then. Thanks for listening, if you have any advice please share.

,Anxiety,"Disclaimer: This is not a essay on whether women or men are more at fault for the detachments that occur between them. Rather it is a summary of on person’s struggle and journey towards finding what can be used to bring them together. Obviously it may be repetitive and annoying, but hopefully it can resonate with people who feel like they are alone in this world and just watch the people with the apparent confidence to share their life enjoy what they cannot.

One element of advice from a man who received more attention than he deserved from women to the anyone who decides to listen: Initiate Conversation with those you subconsciously believe as less than you. This will take practice and experience to learn, but normally if you find something uninteresting or boring, you have a prime opportunity in life to learn and grow for yourself and something else. Please take it.

Whether or not it will serve me well to do this, I am in a state of constant argument with my own mind, morals, and morality. I could choose to walk away from these feelings and accept that the journey to overcome this would be unlikely to succeed. It is why I am writing. As most great adventures go, history will ignore the millions that died while trying. Or as Yoda says, those that do not, are ignored.

At some point in growing up in grade school I started to have overwhelming anxiety that was akin to having a flu’s nausea whenever I missed an assignment. It would be a minimal reading assignment at first or just a missed practice, but would evolve to not showing up for presentations of group projects. Prior to having the internet, a child’s mind had books and old movies to play out and reflect their imaginations. How it was passed to me, I cannot say as I have no recollection of any mention of sex while growing up, but at some point the concept of sex grew out of these mediums. By about 2/3 grade I had somehow discovered what sex was and was given detention by making fun of a girl at school about her wanting to have sex along with another kid. 

Natural bodily functions were functional, necessary, but a bane to existence, I would have issues that had been recurring since I was young. One of my first recollections is having been unable to control myself in the main area of the house and trying to clean shit up myself at around 5 years old. After that, I know I had trouble controlling myself while sleeping. I would either have night terrors and sleep walk, wake up screaming, or else wake up having peed, shit, or vomitted on myself. Well into my elementary school years, my my mother kept a walkie talkie in my room and once caused her to break a toe trying to stop me from doing one of those acts in the middle of the night and went to the hospital. Gloriously these reactions happened at restaurants, but my memory is hazier there. Nightmares where I would recall being at a family meal and not being able to interact with people and becoming very concerned that I would never be able to communicate with anyone. At times this manifested by being at school with a fever and convincing my teachers that any feverish symptoms were due to playing outside.

So welcome to the show. You’ve got the hook. It’s terribly baited. What sexual being would choose something destined to be ignored, pitied, and rejected. One that is logical.

A word of note, the majority of those memories are of a selfish being. A being so mentally incapable of understanding of the outside world that my family’s burden maintaining that kind of child is rarely considered in my head. I was even fascinated by a TV show where a woman was demonstrating methods the mafia used to kill people which stuck in my mind. She would not die, but my thoughts would begin to wonder how to solve those frustrating childish problems.

******
First section isn’t really abuse as the term is commonly understood. While I do believe that physical and sexual abuse are way worse, the action to accept that I was helps me see that others are too and to not act out in reaction if they act in a negative way to me. Mind you it’s taken me 28 years to see this with countless male friends, but admittedly few or one directional female friends spending time with me. This may be identified earlier if the friendships at a younger age are stronger, long lasting, and deeply emotional. In my circumstance it was not.

To not make this a self hating essay, I have to give credit that I made my own friendships for the most part. The concept of parents molding a child’s social circle was ambiguous to me, as mostly is the case for all abusive households. If the parent is struggling there is a good chance that struggle will be passed on to the kid. For the most part I was able to create a world to be successful in. But taking a small sliver of wisdom from Thomas Jefferson (given his own failings at following his own advice): continuously refresh that world. He believed a constitution should be rewritten every 20 years, and a person has much more freedom of movement to accomplish that much more regularly.

******
Avoidance that resulted in long term thoughts and pain started in 4th grade. A girl made it clear she was interested in me during a school game and for now all I recall is that I froze up and could not respond to her. A friend pulled me aside to offer a child’s advice, but it didn’t help. Given I had had other instances of severe anxiety induced by a fear of missing out, it’s not surprising it stuck. But it is blatant how often that repeated itself. People would try to socialize with me on bus rides and I would have none of it. When my guy friends would be attempting to flirt with girls I would make a fool of myself and ruin the sense of secrecy that they were trying to convey. In addition, I would be too friendly around my friends girlfriends. Developing inside jokes about my friends with the girls. Both instances made me an outsider in most intimacy discussions at that stage.

You get the point. Awkward, painfully shy, obnoxiously self centered and not willing to play by the rules, ignoring the fact that the rules were unknown. So to spice that ignorance up: I started to look at photos of naked women on workplace supplied computers where my mother taught. Obviously as any kid would, I had found other mechanisms using catalogs and yearbooks, but that was my first excursion into acting a way that could harm others. I was a loner and loser so making use of my sisters old barbies and dressed them up in “revealing” versions of their clothing to replicate the images I found online when I couldn’t be online was not irrational at the time. Of course I then used my small savings to purchase a PSP knowing it had internet capabilities and from them on only used my mother’s laptop when I needed escalation. Around this time I developed fantasies in my head of dying and the people at school being sad for that happening.

Escalation is the natural entropy of a young guy and trading sleep for more sexual release was a natural tradeoff in my life. I did learn some interesting skills around this time with respect to learning how to down videos and photos and spent hours solving problems that were not even solvable at the time. I was able to skate by school with lucky amount of intelligence and memory that worked in my favor to passing classes that I spent no time on understanding. I would always wait until I was completely satiated to start work, and working by flashlight. This time was heavy with categorizing photos in various structures which was a weird hobby I also had growing up with toys. I inevitably evolved into reading erotic text stories that I found and would spend hours reading trading in my previous passion for reading in general. A concern with the written language that I didn’t realize then, but the imagination with words can be much more elaborate and subversive in daily situations for me. I would catch myself daydreaming at school about the written stories, while I previously had only thought of the photos I had seen online.

Avoiding social situations began at this time. I would go to family reunions or hang out with friends and be distinctly bored by the whole interaction. Wanting to go and do what I would normally do alone and not be able to do so. I would dehydrate myself and choose fantasy over engaging with friends while on trips with them. It started my habit of masturbating in the company of others, but attempting to do so without being noticed became a recurring hobby through college. An inability to have close friendships developed and I would move into different circles in school, with struggles, to begin associating with “smarter” children. This led to a detachment from previous friendships and an evolution to becoming someone who held birthday parties people would rarely attend and at one time, only 1 person did so. My habit of avoiding social situations began by avoiding the 8th grade dance. A girl did comment on it, but I let it just leave my mind as a lie at the time. I then attended a an 8th grade graduation, but shit my pants and stayed at the party while trying to clean up intermittently. I am very confident that I did not pull that off and I never really saw those people again.

Over the next couple years, I would do poorly on class work that required effort rather than just smarts and I started the process of no longer practicing musical instruments. My trumpet was first as I felt that I would impede my TV time and my parents would not appreciate me playing it when they got home. This was also the time my sister and I started to interact as my parents: we would have huge fights and then go watch TV in separate rooms all day. I also started to develop performance anxiety and could never play solos in front of large crowds.

Up until this point, I had been stealing all of my internet connection from our neighbors growing up. But around middle of high school we ended up getting internet. I used some past research to download tools and convert videos and images into more portable formats and continued to expand the amount of photos and videos I saw. I would also start reading not just violent, but kidnap and torture focused stories as well as full on death/murder and found stories with women of questionable ages along with beginning to fund a lot of fascination with Dexter and Criminal Minds.

******
High school gave me more opportunities to both engage socially and then avoid social interaction. Numerous people would try to talk to me, but feeling myself a mixture of unworthy and unlike them inspired a lack of work towards becoming social. High school girls gave me the nickname “failure” at some point due to my performance anxiety. While I went to one homecoming, I avoided the rest and only socialized during school sponsored activities and a few times hung out with friends. A girl talked to me on the bus and I just ranted about something until she no longer wished to talk to me. She also reached out to me at one point and asked if I believed a human brain could think itself into a sickness. To which I chose not to respond besides stating that if it was true, then the opposite had to be also true. Women would openly express a desire to be friends and spend time with me, and I would either pretend not to notice or shut it down if I did not like them sexually.

One person had the determination to make something happen with me instead of just hanging out as part of a friend group. She directly asked me why I hugged another girl and not her and started to hug me. I would respond with asking her to hang out while we avoided doing work in band and even hugging her in front of other people when she “accidentally” put herself close to me. She then put her shaved legs on mine on a bus ride and also cuddled on another. Both times I either was too concerned with stomach issues causing me to relive the anxiety of childhood stomach issues. She helped escalate our interactions, but the anxiety and jealousy of her other male friends and other facts of her social abilities ultimately led me to finding yet more solace in porn as I ran away from her. 

This was not an isolated incident in my fantasies/memories. One girl “accidentally” sat on my arm which was resting on the table while she read something on a wall. I could have asked her to move or shift or say something and instead I just sat still and acted indifferent. Someone even called me out while playing poker (at which I easily lost) and told me that I only played with a good hand. Another time I did the same thing I did in 4th grade and avoided attempting to spend time with someone in fear that she would cut my balls off and I stuck to that viewpoint given many opportunities to modify my actions 

I would decide to double down on written stories about women of uncertain age involved in asphyxia scenarios, torture and electric shock scenarios, as well as death. I would not find this much of an opportunity to change myself until college, and instead I existed in a state of boredom and uncertainty. Unsure of what I was feeling and unwilling to feel it. I did have a reputation for going to friends houses to play video games and playing cheaply without building up any other skills. Admittedly I did not spend time practicing so they had validity to that statement. At the end of high school the only time I took to drink was with my mother when she allowed me to share a sherry my sister had actually received for her graduation. Even then though, I would drink to get drunk. I explicitly recall my mother having to tell me to stop and not keep drinking.

******
Social anxiety and alcohol at college gave me the opportunity to act with freedom from my past isolation. But the missed opportunities kept occurring. On targeted me within a group of random people I helped coordinate and I went after her, a first time for me. We hung out, but when I decided to act on it, she would push back often and didn’t seem to notice that she did get me off, and then did again but made it clear it was not something she enjoyed. Ended up ghosting her just because I couldn’t stay interested in her physically or mentally. Danced with others at a party, but could only do so when blacked out. Otherwise I would never talk to anyone and would only be creepy, by trying to dance with people without talking and touching them without asking.

During this time, my drinking escalated to the point where I worked during the week to drink. In addition, I would take any opportunity on offer to smoke and drink any day of the week and took pride in surviving as well as I did while doing so. Though my grades did begin to drop, my weekly blackouts were not seen by me to be a major concern. I would take liberties in vomiting and forcing people to take care of me on regular occasions following significant binges. Once locking myself out of my dorm, and even more often requiring a clean up process the next day.

This did modify as I went into my second year in college. I would explicitly try to avoid socializing as often, but another issue started where I would begin to budget my efforts and binge more dramatically and had to be taken care of by my new roommates that were not my friends. A key instance was when I was drinking with people after a tough week and while I walked myself home (which I did so often in blackout situations) I ended up waking up a block from my dorm with paramedics taking care of me. I managed to talk them into letting me go home, but this was my first instance of losing all logic after drinking and I was lucky not to get fined as I had messed up an establishment outside of my room.

Porn increased this year as socializing decreased, and I quickly escalated through my previous porn elements and realized I was better off with written material as the videos were not fulfilling what I sought (it was also quieter in the company of others). My search terms went to a much more extreme level and I would spend hours reading and fantasizing while avoid social situations. I also would fantasize while hungover, and with my roommate present. I began to use these processes to get myself to both wakeup and sleep, especially after my times drinking. I would blend visual, written, and moving representations of all the activities that I wanted to blend into an event in my world and exist in that state for hours.

Early in third year I must have felt accomplished after an internship and learning that I could handle a tipsy drive. I went hard into one of the first football games of the season, overdosed on alcohol, and ended up at the hospital. I did discharge myself and met up with a school administrator, but again did not consider a stop to my drinking. I again kept focused on reducing these episodes. But I built confidence to then work very hard during the week, but party recklessly. I also had instances where I would mistake rooms in group retreats and made a fool of myself by going into the wrong beds while blackout or require people to care for me while blackout.

My friends decided to set me up with his girlfriends friend and instead of staying cool headed and try to make a friendship at the least, I got drunk to the point that I left the party and walked 2 miles before I was lucky to hitchhike safely. My final year, my drinking stayed roughly the same and while I did go to jail and failed to manage my drinking at all. However, what I did notice is that once graduation happened I felt a lot more bereft of what the next part of life would bring. It felt numb and without hope. My drinking excursions diminished, but they did not ever stop, nor did I think they should. I would come home from work parties and vomit in my room. Drive drunk after some as well. And it didn’t cross my mind that was a problem. Paranoia began after a bad trip, and most other social anxieties again occurred.

******
At this stage I again lose a bit of the timeline and I know what I would do for porn would amount to edging for hours without letting myself finish. While it had started in school, it came to the primary focus after school. It would allow me to spend hours on my own and get work done, but also manage my emotions during that time. I began to start to use dating apps, but was predictably unsuccessfully. Certain “lucky” situations occurred, which were recreations of high school, but more obviously sexual. 
One grad reunion night, I went home after a party and must have believed I was home so I stripped naked to sleep cooler and avoid night terrors. A friend came down and she told me that she was hungry. Instead of being able to think through what she meant, I grabbed my phone and in a black out tried to order her some food. Another woman I met online did relate to me by being online a lot, but I freaked out when she discussed shock therapy for depression and I could never touch her. I did nothing as she had previously made it clear she had been sexually assaulted at parties.

I did end up spending time in a friends town that I went to college with, but when the night got later, we both just got blackout. I groped, but did not progress past when I stopped hearing her moaning, but it was concerning to me, that I do recall it even though it was such a foggy night in general. I do recall that later that night I mistook a closet for a bathroom and had to clean that up in the middle of the night. Similar bathroom problems also occurred while staying with other friends later that year. 

Drinking and being confused kept happening and I would end up in my previous apartments trying to reason with the new residents about where I was supposed to be. I also returned to old AirBNBs and would attempt to break in while blackout. While at festivals and with friends I would choose to take certain days off, but I also began to experience some serious digestive concerns as well while eating and drinking too aggressively. I had a habit of vomiting in hotel rooms or in airbnbs with the frequency of my college days. Experiments of drinking and taking edibles alone just to relax by myself became commonplace. This was enjoyable, but became an emotional roller coaster and I ended up texting people from work multiple times during these situations. Socially I would get kicked out of restaurants because I could not hold myself together or lose my ID and phone while out with people. The expenses, time, worry, I had in recovering my phone/wallet/ID was life changing and helped me again try to cut back. Unsuccessfully.

At this time I had developed a significant habit of masturbating to a concoction of multiple different forms of porn and regularly switching between then over multiple sessions and in a single one to keep my mind from becoming stalled. ASMR porn paired it with Porn Music videos which used rave and epileptic level flashes in scenery to up and relax my sexual stimulation. I did notice that I would come home from work and use the PMV for an upper and the ASMR videos as a downer just before bed. This would help me relax and not worry about the next day. I had scenarios where I would being reading the stories that I had found on work trips and trips to see friends and would plan to read them on the plane. I would read them on trains places (as they are more separated from each other). I also made it possible to listen to these stories while I was driving and would drive home on long road trips where I would be masturbating myself while driving, but doing so in a manner that would only be edging so that I would avoid the consequences of something more serious.

Around this time I met a series of coworkers that I tried to do initiate with and I let them into my head They helped shape my understanding of trust in friends. We played tennis, went on hikes, and went skiing. They ultimately invited me to their apartment twice, I invited them to mine once, and they flaked on me once. They would make references to their “pet names” boyfriends had and were calling them, and other emotional bids. When I recall telling them about listening to ASMR, I do recall my other coworkers “coincidentally” bringing it up the next day. Hours on the phone and at dinners with just talking about life in general and solving problems for work well into the night as well as sharing book recommendations. They argued with me and talked to me about work in ways I only now realized they had little care for. They let their guard down near me at work, not harassing, but letting clothing slip and stating things with sexual connotations I have heard and decided to do nothing about. Sky diving, a concert (where I lost my mind and grinded on one of them the entire time and lost my ability to tell directions or do anything), and other work trips and even sleep in the same bed as I did made a significant impact on my view of women in the world and how they viewed me.

I then met a friends sister (same friend as from college who set me up a lot) and she asked me out while we were on an ecstasy trip. I felt a relief like being back in high school and immediately unloaded about the 3 work friends. She would listen and seemingly understand what I was going through, but she kept at it and she and I would call once a week. Our interactions awakened a feeling of paranoia in my mind. My mother would vent on her marriage to her friends, which were mutual to my dad. Ultimately I felt a fear that if I messed up, my actions would reverberate through my friend group and ruin what little reputation I had. At this point she pointed out she only saw me as a friend. We spent time on a vacation and I didn’t initiate fearing I still didn’t understand what was happening. However, I got fed up when she visited DC for some friends and took a risk to make a move on her, that I could barely understand myself. We had sex, but about halfway through I do recall my roommate coming back and immediately having paranoia about bothering his night. So while I tried to keep going, I lost my erection. We did wake up the next day and I wanted to engage her, but I recall being very rough and ashamed for being so. Later in her home town the next month I went to a party with her and her work friends and I do not recall much besides getting drunk. Hearing her that night saying she didn’t want to have sex, and then taking that to mean she had to be explicit with me the entire rest of the trip for me to be allowed to initiate again. She never was and I remember just watching her sleep without doing anything. We ultimately had our last discussion before she left about how she wanted to just have fun and how I was not seeing what the point of fun was.

After this year, I ended up not only facing consequences by drinking, lusting, and smoking. This fell apart after I began to move away from the people that I worked well with even though I felt that my life was starting to change. I drove drunk and got into difficulties while driving and texting with a coworker I was interested in. This along with the breakup of the work team, and a fight with one of the coworkers led me into a spiral that culminated in a multiple instances of driving drunk and then blacking out and losing my phone, wallet, and laptop. I identified and took action on staying sober at this point, though I cannot recall the exact reason for joining the support group I did. I did keep smoking for a few months, but I was a regular dick in any social situation and otherwise I would just collapse in my head and not talk to anyone depending on the level of the high.

About 3 months into sobriety I realized that porn was either just as bad or worse than the drinking. Namely the days I would lose to hangovers would become ever more lost due to the weekends spent masturbating. I had also started to use anonymous browsers and started making accounts for online forums to view the content. I did start interacting with people as well, but it was largely as a means to streamline and encourage more content rather than actively trying to provide my own. This also became a period of time during which I realized how much masturbation would help me sleep as my two weeks of avoiding it resulted in poor sleep and restless mornings. I lasted about two weeks without porn once. But I would start to travel and land myself in situations where I would spend entire nights on my own in different cities instead of with people in the support groups, with friends, or more importantly just resting.

I did end up meeting two other women online, and I enjoyed one’s company (though she did admit to scamming from an online marketplace). She ultimately took the lead in getting me into her room on our second date, but seemed to know the entire time that she could do that and that I wouldn’t have the ability to lead her there myself. She tried to have sex, but I was still not happy with my last performance, so I settled for lesser options and didn’t meet her view on it as a one night stand maturely for a while. I made a female friend in one of my groups and when speaking with her one on one, she openly told me about her skills at oral, but that she didn’t like to talk about it. I decided to mock her for how she changed her moods and said terrible things to her via text, to which she has since stopped talking to me. This repeated itself with a friend from college. I would repeatedly talk down about myself and question her decision making for her past experiences she was describing to me. In both cases I was actively trying to avoid intimacy in order to just get to sex if possible.

On a trip with the red cross I ended up meeting a woman also volunteering but on a different shift. I didn’t have the guts to exchange numbers immediately and another volunteer was kind enough to initiate that for me. Effectively we did chat, but I decided I had no chance at some point and while I believe she was trying, I stopped. Attended a wedding where I could have at least tried to talk to one of the bridesmaids. I made a fear based decision not to do so. Then I drank I glass of champagne and started to follow whiskey around the party and decided to bail out of the situation.

For about another year, I would keep this process going of intermittently watching or reading porn and my interests began to shift to harder mainstream avenues (along with the industry in general) but I would also find myself reading and listening to interviews of the actresses and sometimes other performers and began to feel drawn to them as people and less of an urge to partake in watching their actions. Rather I wanted to start getting involved in the actions myself. I was then unable to stop for many circumstances and while I would work to avoid cannibalism and death porn, I would make slips into that and PMV and hardcore aspects. In affect, I would go to meetings to work to remove this urge and know that I had just come from watching porn and that I would go right back to it.

******
My perspective alternates now between viewpoints that are summarized by the below:

At this point, I cannot keep sexual imagery out of my head when interacting with women and repeatedly get frustrated by not being able to talk to them long enough to at least discuss that topic. I have tried to engage in erotic writing, but fail to put in the real time/effort to make that a reality. I have lost long term determination to create and develop an artistic skill. I repeatedly binge and purge with respect to physical fitness, socializing, adrenaline, and entertainment now and it is a daily struggle not to just watch porn. There is a good chance that when I read this I may have already slipped that day.

I get that it takes time to learn these things, but it’s a daily struggle at the moment to confirm I want to. I did see people at gyms try to speak with me and avoided them and I know that as time goes on I sense that I will want less and less to do with women. Due to sheer frustration. I understand I have to keep trying and persevere, but there’s a time to reflect on whether I am not following my path.

But every day, I feel a sense of hope that I can overcome small elements of these social and emotional fears that I have been working for years to avoid. Whether it happens is unknown. But I hope that my time working on this will give others hope that there will be a chance to overcome theirs in time. Most importantly of all is the belief that all of the women and men that have played unnecessarily dedicated roles in helping me see where I currently am can also exist for others as long as people are willing to put aside their normal social norms and find those that are hiding behind their fears. If you have made it this far, you probably are someone who is capable of doing just that. So do not give up and only pick 1 or 2 favorites to improve the days of. Fight to be a beacon of hope for all who are suffering, whether they demonstrate they deserve it or not.",t2_68s7oqfl,False,,0,False,A Person in Progress,[],r/Anxiety,False,0,victory-recurring,0,,,False,t3_k2qow5,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Share Your Victories,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1606610175.0,text,0,,,text,self.Anxiety,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This is not a essay on whether women or men are more at fault for the detachments that occur between them. Rather it is a summary of on person’s struggle and journey towards finding what can be used to bring them together. Obviously it may be repetitive and annoying, but hopefully it can resonate with people who feel like they are alone in this world and just watch the people with the apparent confidence to share their life enjoy what they cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One element of advice from a man who received more attention than he deserved from women to the anyone who decides to listen: Initiate Conversation with those you subconsciously believe as less than you. This will take practice and experience to learn, but normally if you find something uninteresting or boring, you have a prime opportunity in life to learn and grow for yourself and something else. Please take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not it will serve me well to do this, I am in a state of constant argument with my own mind, morals, and morality. I could choose to walk away from these feelings and accept that the journey to overcome this would be unlikely to succeed. It is why I am writing. As most great adventures go, history will ignore the millions that died while trying. Or as Yoda says, those that do not, are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in growing up in grade school I started to have overwhelming anxiety that was akin to having a flu’s nausea whenever I missed an assignment. It would be a minimal reading assignment at first or just a missed practice, but would evolve to not showing up for presentations of group projects. Prior to having the internet, a child’s mind had books and old movies to play out and reflect their imaginations. How it was passed to me, I cannot say as I have no recollection of any mention of sex while growing up, but at some point the concept of sex grew out of these mediums. By about 2/3 grade I had somehow discovered what sex was and was given detention by making fun of a girl at school about her wanting to have sex along with another kid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural bodily functions were functional, necessary, but a bane to existence, I would have issues that had been recurring since I was young. One of my first recollections is having been unable to control myself in the main area of the house and trying to clean shit up myself at around 5 years old. After that, I know I had trouble controlling myself while sleeping. I would either have night terrors and sleep walk, wake up screaming, or else wake up having peed, shit, or vomitted on myself. Well into my elementary school years, my my mother kept a walkie talkie in my room and once caused her to break a toe trying to stop me from doing one of those acts in the middle of the night and went to the hospital. Gloriously these reactions happened at restaurants, but my memory is hazier there. Nightmares where I would recall being at a family meal and not being able to interact with people and becoming very concerned that I would never be able to communicate with anyone. At times this manifested by being at school with a fever and convincing my teachers that any feverish symptoms were due to playing outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So welcome to the show. You’ve got the hook. It’s terribly baited. What sexual being would choose something destined to be ignored, pitied, and rejected. One that is logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of note, the majority of those memories are of a selfish being. A being so mentally incapable of understanding of the outside world that my family’s burden maintaining that kind of child is rarely considered in my head. I was even fascinated by a TV show where a woman was demonstrating methods the mafia used to kill people which stuck in my mind. She would not die, but my thoughts would begin to wonder how to solve those frustrating childish problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First section isn’t really abuse as the term is commonly understood. While I do believe that physical and sexual abuse are way worse, the action to accept that I was helps me see that others are too and to not act out in reaction if they act in a negative way to me. Mind you it’s taken me 28 years to see this with countless male friends, but admittedly few or one directional female friends spending time with me. This may be identified earlier if the friendships at a younger age are stronger, long lasting, and deeply emotional. In my circumstance it was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To not make this a self hating essay, I have to give credit that I made my own friendships for the most part. The concept of parents molding a child’s social circle was ambiguous to me, as mostly is the case for all abusive households. If the parent is struggling there is a good chance that struggle will be passed on to the kid. For the most part I was able to create a world to be successful in. But taking a small sliver of wisdom from Thomas Jefferson (given his own failings at following his own advice): continuously refresh that world. He believed a constitution should be rewritten every 20 years, and a person has much more freedom of movement to accomplish that much more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoidance that resulted in long term thoughts and pain started in 4th grade. A girl made it clear she was interested in me during a school game and for now all I recall is that I froze up and could not respond to her. A friend pulled me aside to offer a child’s advice, but it didn’t help. Given I had had other instances of severe anxiety induced by a fear of missing out, it’s not surprising it stuck. But it is blatant how often that repeated itself. People would try to socialize with me on bus rides and I would have none of it. When my guy friends would be attempting to flirt with girls I would make a fool of myself and ruin the sense of secrecy that they were trying to convey. In addition, I would be too friendly around my friends girlfriends. Developing inside jokes about my friends with the girls. Both instances made me an outsider in most intimacy discussions at that stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the point. Awkward, painfully shy, obnoxiously self centered and not willing to play by the rules, ignoring the fact that the rules were unknown. So to spice that ignorance up: I started to look at photos of naked women on workplace supplied computers where my mother taught. Obviously as any kid would, I had found other mechanisms using catalogs and yearbooks, but that was my first excursion into acting a way that could harm others. I was a loner and loser so making use of my sisters old barbies and dressed them up in “revealing” versions of their clothing to replicate the images I found online when I couldn’t be online was not irrational at the time. Of course I then used my small savings to purchase a PSP knowing it had internet capabilities and from them on only used my mother’s laptop when I needed escalation. Around this time I developed fantasies in my head of dying and the people at school being sad for that happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalation is the natural entropy of a young guy and trading sleep for more sexual release was a natural tradeoff in my life. I did learn some interesting skills around this time with respect to learning how to down videos and photos and spent hours solving problems that were not even solvable at the time. I was able to skate by school with lucky amount of intelligence and memory that worked in my favor to passing classes that I spent no time on understanding. I would always wait until I was completely satiated to start work, and working by flashlight. This time was heavy with categorizing photos in various structures which was a weird hobby I also had growing up with toys. I inevitably evolved into reading erotic text stories that I found and would spend hours reading trading in my previous passion for reading in general. A concern with the written language that I didn’t realize then, but the imagination with words can be much more elaborate and subversive in daily situations for me. I would catch myself daydreaming at school about the written stories, while I previously had only thought of the photos I had seen online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding social situations began at this time. I would go to family reunions or hang out with friends and be distinctly bored by the whole interaction. Wanting to go and do what I would normally do alone and not be able to do so. I would dehydrate myself and choose fantasy over engaging with friends while on trips with them. It started my habit of masturbating in the company of others, but attempting to do so without being noticed became a recurring hobby through college. An inability to have close friendships developed and I would move into different circles in school, with struggles, to begin associating with “smarter” children. This led to a detachment from previous friendships and an evolution to becoming someone who held birthday parties people would rarely attend and at one time, only 1 person did so. My habit of avoiding social situations began by avoiding the 8th grade dance. A girl did comment on it, but I let it just leave my mind as a lie at the time. I then attended a an 8th grade graduation, but shit my pants and stayed at the party while trying to clean up intermittently. I am very confident that I did not pull that off and I never really saw those people again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple years, I would do poorly on class work that required effort rather than just smarts and I started the process of no longer practicing musical instruments. My trumpet was first as I felt that I would impede my TV time and my parents would not appreciate me playing it when they got home. This was also the time my sister and I started to interact as my parents: we would have huge fights and then go watch TV in separate rooms all day. I also started to develop performance anxiety and could never play solos in front of large crowds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, I had been stealing all of my internet connection from our neighbors growing up. But around middle of high school we ended up getting internet. I used some past research to download tools and convert videos and images into more portable formats and continued to expand the amount of photos and videos I saw. I would also start reading not just violent, but kidnap and torture focused stories as well as full on death/murder and found stories with women of questionable ages along with beginning to fund a lot of fascination with Dexter and Criminal Minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High school gave me more opportunities to both engage socially and then avoid social interaction. Numerous people would try to talk to me, but feeling myself a mixture of unworthy and unlike them inspired a lack of work towards becoming social. High school girls gave me the nickname “failure” at some point due to my performance anxiety. While I went to one homecoming, I avoided the rest and only socialized during school sponsored activities and a few times hung out with friends. A girl talked to me on the bus and I just ranted about something until she no longer wished to talk to me. She also reached out to me at one point and asked if I believed a human brain could think itself into a sickness. To which I chose not to respond besides stating that if it was true, then the opposite had to be also true. Women would openly express a desire to be friends and spend time with me, and I would either pretend not to notice or shut it down if I did not like them sexually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One person had the determination to make something happen with me instead of just hanging out as part of a friend group. She directly asked me why I hugged another girl and not her and started to hug me. I would respond with asking her to hang out while we avoided doing work in band and even hugging her in front of other people when she “accidentally” put herself close to me. She then put her shaved legs on mine on a bus ride and also cuddled on another. Both times I either was too concerned with stomach issues causing me to relive the anxiety of childhood stomach issues. She helped escalate our interactions, but the anxiety and jealousy of her other male friends and other facts of her social abilities ultimately led me to finding yet more solace in porn as I ran away from her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not an isolated incident in my fantasies/memories. One girl “accidentally” sat on my arm which was resting on the table while she read something on a wall. I could have asked her to move or shift or say something and instead I just sat still and acted indifferent. Someone even called me out while playing poker (at which I easily lost) and told me that I only played with a good hand. Another time I did the same thing I did in 4th grade and avoided attempting to spend time with someone in fear that she would cut my balls off and I stuck to that viewpoint given many opportunities to modify my actions &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would decide to double down on written stories about women of uncertain age involved in asphyxia scenarios, torture and electric shock scenarios, as well as death. I would not find this much of an opportunity to change myself until college, and instead I existed in a state of boredom and uncertainty. Unsure of what I was feeling and unwilling to feel it. I did have a reputation for going to friends houses to play video games and playing cheaply without building up any other skills. Admittedly I did not spend time practicing so they had validity to that statement. At the end of high school the only time I took to drink was with my mother when she allowed me to share a sherry my sister had actually received for her graduation. Even then though, I would drink to get drunk. I explicitly recall my mother having to tell me to stop and not keep drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety and alcohol at college gave me the opportunity to act with freedom from my past isolation. But the missed opportunities kept occurring. On targeted me within a group of random people I helped coordinate and I went after her, a first time for me. We hung out, but when I decided to act on it, she would push back often and didn’t seem to notice that she did get me off, and then did again but made it clear it was not something she enjoyed. Ended up ghosting her just because I couldn’t stay interested in her physically or mentally. Danced with others at a party, but could only do so when blacked out. Otherwise I would never talk to anyone and would only be creepy, by trying to dance with people without talking and touching them without asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, my drinking escalated to the point where I worked during the week to drink. In addition, I would take any opportunity on offer to smoke and drink any day of the week and took pride in surviving as well as I did while doing so. Though my grades did begin to drop, my weekly blackouts were not seen by me to be a major concern. I would take liberties in vomiting and forcing people to take care of me on regular occasions following significant binges. Once locking myself out of my dorm, and even more often requiring a clean up process the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did modify as I went into my second year in college. I would explicitly try to avoid socializing as often, but another issue started where I would begin to budget my efforts and binge more dramatically and had to be taken care of by my new roommates that were not my friends. A key instance was when I was drinking with people after a tough week and while I walked myself home (which I did so often in blackout situations) I ended up waking up a block from my dorm with paramedics taking care of me. I managed to talk them into letting me go home, but this was my first instance of losing all logic after drinking and I was lucky not to get fined as I had messed up an establishment outside of my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porn increased this year as socializing decreased, and I quickly escalated through my previous porn elements and realized I was better off with written material as the videos were not fulfilling what I sought (it was also quieter in the company of others). My search terms went to a much more extreme level and I would spend hours reading and fantasizing while avoid social situations. I also would fantasize while hungover, and with my roommate present. I began to use these processes to get myself to both wakeup and sleep, especially after my times drinking. I would blend visual, written, and moving representations of all the activities that I wanted to blend into an event in my world and exist in that state for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in third year I must have felt accomplished after an internship and learning that I could handle a tipsy drive. I went hard into one of the first football games of the season, overdosed on alcohol, and ended up at the hospital. I did discharge myself and met up with a school administrator, but again did not consider a stop to my drinking. I again kept focused on reducing these episodes. But I built confidence to then work very hard during the week, but party recklessly. I also had instances where I would mistake rooms in group retreats and made a fool of myself by going into the wrong beds while blackout or require people to care for me while blackout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends decided to set me up with his girlfriends friend and instead of staying cool headed and try to make a friendship at the least, I got drunk to the point that I left the party and walked 2 miles before I was lucky to hitchhike safely. My final year, my drinking stayed roughly the same and while I did go to jail and failed to manage my drinking at all. However, what I did notice is that once graduation happened I felt a lot more bereft of what the next part of life would bring. It felt numb and without hope. My drinking excursions diminished, but they did not ever stop, nor did I think they should. I would come home from work parties and vomit in my room. Drive drunk after some as well. And it didn’t cross my mind that was a problem. Paranoia began after a bad trip, and most other social anxieties again occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage I again lose a bit of the timeline and I know what I would do for porn would amount to edging for hours without letting myself finish. While it had started in school, it came to the primary focus after school. It would allow me to spend hours on my own and get work done, but also manage my emotions during that time. I began to start to use dating apps, but was predictably unsuccessfully. Certain “lucky” situations occurred, which were recreations of high school, but more obviously sexual. 
One grad reunion night, I went home after a party and must have believed I was home so I stripped naked to sleep cooler and avoid night terrors. A friend came down and she told me that she was hungry. Instead of being able to think through what she meant, I grabbed my phone and in a black out tried to order her some food. Another woman I met online did relate to me by being online a lot, but I freaked out when she discussed shock therapy for depression and I could never touch her. I did nothing as she had previously made it clear she had been sexually assaulted at parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did end up spending time in a friends town that I went to college with, but when the night got later, we both just got blackout. I groped, but did not progress past when I stopped hearing her moaning, but it was concerning to me, that I do recall it even though it was such a foggy night in general. I do recall that later that night I mistook a closet for a bathroom and had to clean that up in the middle of the night. Similar bathroom problems also occurred while staying with other friends later that year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking and being confused kept happening and I would end up in my previous apartments trying to reason with the new residents about where I was supposed to be. I also returned to old AirBNBs and would attempt to break in while blackout. While at festivals and with friends I would choose to take certain days off, but I also began to experience some serious digestive concerns as well while eating and drinking too aggressively. I had a habit of vomiting in hotel rooms or in airbnbs with the frequency of my college days. Experiments of drinking and taking edibles alone just to relax by myself became commonplace. This was enjoyable, but became an emotional roller coaster and I ended up texting people from work multiple times during these situations. Socially I would get kicked out of restaurants because I could not hold myself together or lose my ID and phone while out with people. The expenses, time, worry, I had in recovering my phone/wallet/ID was life changing and helped me again try to cut back. Unsuccessfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time I had developed a significant habit of masturbating to a concoction of multiple different forms of porn and regularly switching between then over multiple sessions and in a single one to keep my mind from becoming stalled. ASMR porn paired it with Porn Music videos which used rave and epileptic level flashes in scenery to up and relax my sexual stimulation. I did notice that I would come home from work and use the PMV for an upper and the ASMR videos as a downer just before bed. This would help me relax and not worry about the next day. I had scenarios where I would being reading the stories that I had found on work trips and trips to see friends and would plan to read them on the plane. I would read them on trains places (as they are more separated from each other). I also made it possible to listen to these stories while I was driving and would drive home on long road trips where I would be masturbating myself while driving, but doing so in a manner that would only be edging so that I would avoid the consequences of something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time I met a series of coworkers that I tried to do initiate with and I let them into my head They helped shape my understanding of trust in friends. We played tennis, went on hikes, and went skiing. They ultimately invited me to their apartment twice, I invited them to mine once, and they flaked on me once. They would make references to their “pet names” boyfriends had and were calling them, and other emotional bids. When I recall telling them about listening to ASMR, I do recall my other coworkers “coincidentally” bringing it up the next day. Hours on the phone and at dinners with just talking about life in general and solving problems for work well into the night as well as sharing book recommendations. They argued with me and talked to me about work in ways I only now realized they had little care for. They let their guard down near me at work, not harassing, but letting clothing slip and stating things with sexual connotations I have heard and decided to do nothing about. Sky diving, a concert (where I lost my mind and grinded on one of them the entire time and lost my ability to tell directions or do anything), and other work trips and even sleep in the same bed as I did made a significant impact on my view of women in the world and how they viewed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then met a friends sister (same friend as from college who set me up a lot) and she asked me out while we were on an ecstasy trip. I felt a relief like being back in high school and immediately unloaded about the 3 work friends. She would listen and seemingly understand what I was going through, but she kept at it and she and I would call once a week. Our interactions awakened a feeling of paranoia in my mind. My mother would vent on her marriage to her friends, which were mutual to my dad. Ultimately I felt a fear that if I messed up, my actions would reverberate through my friend group and ruin what little reputation I had. At this point she pointed out she only saw me as a friend. We spent time on a vacation and I didn’t initiate fearing I still didn’t understand what was happening. However, I got fed up when she visited DC for some friends and took a risk to make a move on her, that I could barely understand myself. We had sex, but about halfway through I do recall my roommate coming back and immediately having paranoia about bothering his night. So while I tried to keep going, I lost my erection. We did wake up the next day and I wanted to engage her, but I recall being very rough and ashamed for being so. Later in her home town the next month I went to a party with her and her work friends and I do not recall much besides getting drunk. Hearing her that night saying she didn’t want to have sex, and then taking that to mean she had to be explicit with me the entire rest of the trip for me to be allowed to initiate again. She never was and I remember just watching her sleep without doing anything. We ultimately had our last discussion before she left about how she wanted to just have fun and how I was not seeing what the point of fun was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this year, I ended up not only facing consequences by drinking, lusting, and smoking. This fell apart after I began to move away from the people that I worked well with even though I felt that my life was starting to change. I drove drunk and got into difficulties while driving and texting with a coworker I was interested in. This along with the breakup of the work team, and a fight with one of the coworkers led me into a spiral that culminated in a multiple instances of driving drunk and then blacking out and losing my phone, wallet, and laptop. I identified and took action on staying sober at this point, though I cannot recall the exact reason for joining the support group I did. I did keep smoking for a few months, but I was a regular dick in any social situation and otherwise I would just collapse in my head and not talk to anyone depending on the level of the high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 3 months into sobriety I realized that porn was either just as bad or worse than the drinking. Namely the days I would lose to hangovers would become ever more lost due to the weekends spent masturbating. I had also started to use anonymous browsers and started making accounts for online forums to view the content. I did start interacting with people as well, but it was largely as a means to streamline and encourage more content rather than actively trying to provide my own. This also became a period of time during which I realized how much masturbation would help me sleep as my two weeks of avoiding it resulted in poor sleep and restless mornings. I lasted about two weeks without porn once. But I would start to travel and land myself in situations where I would spend entire nights on my own in different cities instead of with people in the support groups, with friends, or more importantly just resting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did end up meeting two other women online, and I enjoyed one’s company (though she did admit to scamming from an online marketplace). She ultimately took the lead in getting me into her room on our second date, but seemed to know the entire time that she could do that and that I wouldn’t have the ability to lead her there myself. She tried to have sex, but I was still not happy with my last performance, so I settled for lesser options and didn’t meet her view on it as a one night stand maturely for a while. I made a female friend in one of my groups and when speaking with her one on one, she openly told me about her skills at oral, but that she didn’t like to talk about it. I decided to mock her for how she changed her moods and said terrible things to her via text, to which she has since stopped talking to me. This repeated itself with a friend from college. I would repeatedly talk down about myself and question her decision making for her past experiences she was describing to me. In both cases I was actively trying to avoid intimacy in order to just get to sex if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a trip with the red cross I ended up meeting a woman also volunteering but on a different shift. I didn’t have the guts to exchange numbers immediately and another volunteer was kind enough to initiate that for me. Effectively we did chat, but I decided I had no chance at some point and while I believe she was trying, I stopped. Attended a wedding where I could have at least tried to talk to one of the bridesmaids. I made a fear based decision not to do so. Then I drank I glass of champagne and started to follow whiskey around the party and decided to bail out of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For about another year, I would keep this process going of intermittently watching or reading porn and my interests began to shift to harder mainstream avenues (along with the industry in general) but I would also find myself reading and listening to interviews of the actresses and sometimes other performers and began to feel drawn to them as people and less of an urge to partake in watching their actions. Rather I wanted to start getting involved in the actions myself. I was then unable to stop for many circumstances and while I would work to avoid cannibalism and death porn, I would make slips into that and PMV and hardcore aspects. In affect, I would go to meetings to work to remove this urge and know that I had just come from watching porn and that I would go right back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perspective alternates now between viewpoints that are summarized by the below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I cannot keep sexual imagery out of my head when interacting with women and repeatedly get frustrated by not being able to talk to them long enough to at least discuss that topic. I have tried to engage in erotic writing, but fail to put in the real time/effort to make that a reality. I have lost long term determination to create and develop an artistic skill. I repeatedly binge and purge with respect to physical fitness, socializing, adrenaline, and entertainment now and it is a daily struggle not to just watch porn. There is a good chance that when I read this I may have already slipped that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that it takes time to learn these things, but it’s a daily struggle at the moment to confirm I want to. I did see people at gyms try to speak with me and avoided them and I know that as time goes on I sense that I will want less and less to do with women. Due to sheer frustration. I understand I have to keep trying and persevere, but there’s a time to reflect on whether I am not following my path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every day, I feel a sense of hope that I can overcome small elements of these social and emotional fears that I have been working for years to avoid. Whether it happens is unknown. But I hope that my time working on this will give others hope that there will be a chance to overcome theirs in time. Most importantly of all is the belief that all of the women and men that have played unnecessarily dedicated roles in helping me see where I currently am can also exist for others as long as people are willing to put aside their normal social norms and find those that are hiding behind their fears. If you have made it this far, you probably are someone who is capable of doing just that. So do not give up and only pick 1 or 2 favorites to improve the days of. Fight to be a beacon of hope for all who are suffering, whether they demonstrate they deserve it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have been previously diagnosed with anxiety as a direct result of these experiences but I'm second guessing it. I'm just curious if anyone else has panic/anxiety attacks like these, I guess I just need some reassurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday morning I got very upset. I couldn't calm down and it was getting time to go to work so I took phenibut (which usually calms me down), and had another energy drink (bringing my total for the day up to 2).

&amp;#x200B;

4 hours into my shift and I was still pretty upset, my coworkers went to smoke (a blunt) and asked if I wanted a hit so I took it.  Not to long after I started to

* Hallucinate.
* Get very dizzy.
* Get extremely hot.
* Get extremely nauseous.
* Lose my vision.
* Lose my hearing.
* Lose control of my body.

It was then that I asked my coworker to cover for me so I could use the bathroom. I thought I might puke so I stood over the toilet but everything started to get even more intense, and I started to black out. I went to the sink to put cold water on my scorching head and kept hitting my head on the mirror because I could not longer hold myself up to well.

&amp;#x200B;

I opened the bathroom door thinking I should have someone call 911, but forget I undid my belt to relieve pressure on my stomach. I shut the door to get my belt back on and the next time I opened my eyes I was on the floor, sitting on my knees against the wall... I heard a bang before I opened my eyes to this so I assume I passed out and hit my head. It hurt pretty bad and still does honestly. After this experience everything felt like a game, not real.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the symptoms I experienced are 

* Hallucinating.
* Dizziness.
* Hot flashes I'm assuming, it felt like i was on fire.
* Vision loss.
* Hearing loss.
* Loss of consciousness.
* Nausea.
* Motor control loss.
* De-realization.
* De-personalization? (I didn't feel real).

This intense episode lasted what felt like a couple minutes, not sure how long it actually lasted. Usually it takes at least a month for me to fully recover from these. Does anyone else have these kind of panic/anxiety attacks? Or should I schedule an appointment with my doctor to have some tests done?  I also felt like everywhere about an inch away from my eyes were numb, don't know if they were but they had that feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

They usually happen whenever I'm very worked up about something, mainly when I'm mad and stressed out. It made work very difficult (I work night shift). And my manager told me I looked awful, my skin was pretty pale and so were my lips from what I seen. I would've liked to be sent home but they probably though I was just high, if only they knew. But I guess they don't get paid enough to care.

My partner says I suffer from &amp;quot;imposter syndrome&amp;quot;. Anyway, I responded to an email where many people were cc&amp;#39;d and I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about how they might respond. Will it be so apparent that I don&amp;#39;t have a complete grasp on everything, will it be offensive? I proofread it a million times...what&amp;#39;s difficult is the weekend is here and I will be on vacation for a week. I will be so tempted to check my email, but I try to force myself to disconnect from work when I&amp;#39;m on vacation so I don&amp;#39;t want to check my email. Unfortunately, that hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet since I&amp;#39;m anticipating their responses.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"hi. ive never posted here before but I'm an 18 year old girl who's struggled with anxiety my whole life. ever since I can remember I've been on edge, just always worrying that something bad is gonna happen, that kind of thing. but I've known what anxiety feels like, I've felt it.

in the past week my anxiety has gotten so bad it feels like a different type of anxiety. I'm getting nauseous, it feels like constant panic. And it stems from my dad.

My dad is an alcoholic, (recovering, but has relapsed a lot and drinks occasionally, hides liquor from my mom etc.) and has a HUGE anger problem. some of my earliest memories as a child was hearing my dad slam the door upstairs and start screaming bloody murder at my mom and I knew that was my cue to go to my room and put my headphones in.

stuff was okay for a while but never got resolved. the other day I got into a very minor argument with my mom over something trivial, that me and her were just about done figuring out. and my dad interjects and starts raising his voice at me saying I need to watch the way I talk to my mom.  and I kinda snapped and said ""maybe I don't like the way YOU talk to MY mom, dad."" and he lost it. he fucking lost it and me and my mom both said we'd never seen or heard him yell and scream this loud and my mom looked frightened so I took out my phone and told my dad I was gonna call 911. he said if I did that, that it would be, and I quote, ""the last fucking phone call I'll ever make and I'll smash that fucking phone to pieces."" I panicked in that second. My dad is supposed to be my protector, care for me, and here he is saying if I call 911 it would be the last call I'd ever make.

I broke down crying and ran to my room, felt like I had my first ever mental breakdown. ever since then there's been little things each day with them, my dad apparently ""bullying"" my mom into changing some password with some finance thing because my mom wants to leave him and I don't know how all that works, but when my mom said my dad was bullying her I broke down again.

ive been bullied, I know that pain. and I guess where I'll leave off here is I've had it. my mind hurts, I'm in a state of panic, disgust, confusion, pain, I don't even fucking know what anymore. i honestly have felt suicidal the last couple of days and I need help.

&lt;p&gt;in the past week my anxiety has gotten so bad it feels like a different type of anxiety. I&amp;#39;m getting nauseous, it feels like constant panic. And it stems from my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad is an alcoholic, (recovering, but has relapsed a lot and drinks occasionally, hides liquor from my mom etc.) and has a HUGE anger problem. some of my earliest memories as a child was hearing my dad slam the door upstairs and start screaming bloody murder at my mom and I knew that was my cue to go to my room and put my headphones in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;stuff was okay for a while but never got resolved. the other day I got into a very minor argument with my mom over something trivial, that me and her were just about done figuring out. and my dad interjects and starts raising his voice at me saying I need to watch the way I talk to my mom.  and I kinda snapped and said &amp;quot;maybe I don&amp;#39;t like the way YOU talk to MY mom, dad.&amp;quot; and he lost it. he fucking lost it and me and my mom both said we&amp;#39;d never seen or heard him yell and scream this loud and my mom looked frightened so I took out my phone and told my dad I was gonna call 911. he said if I did that, that it would be, and I quote, &amp;quot;the last fucking phone call I&amp;#39;ll ever make and I&amp;#39;ll smash that fucking phone to pieces.&amp;quot; I panicked in that second. My dad is supposed to be my protector, care for me, and here he is saying if I call 911 it would be the last call I&amp;#39;d ever make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke down crying and ran to my room, felt like I had my first ever mental breakdown. ever since then there&amp;#39;s been little things each day with them, my dad apparently &amp;quot;bullying&amp;quot; my mom into changing some password with some finance thing because my mom wants to leave him and I don&amp;#39;t know how all that works, but when my mom said my dad was bullying her I broke down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ive been bullied, I know that pain. and I guess where I&amp;#39;ll leave off here is I&amp;#39;ve had it. my mind hurts, I&amp;#39;m in a state of panic, disgust, confusion, pain, I don&amp;#39;t even fucking know what anymore. i honestly have felt suicidal the last couple of days and I need help. I know I need to go to therapy but I&amp;#39;ve been working a lot and just haven&amp;#39;t called one yet. i just want a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

My SO plays video games with his old high school friends. He does this in “seasons” for example if a new game comes out. Then after a month or so he gets bored of it and doesn’t play with them for months. But the times he does play with them makes me really anxious. 

One reason why is his “friends” can really piss him off. As many others he can get really upset when not doing well at the game or sometimes the teamwork is shitty or someone brings up politics. Unfortunately for me he does not have a good hold on his anger, and like fire can light up any situation he encounters after playing with these old friends. Often he will get snappy with me as a result of being mad at them. I’m a very anxious and previously abused person so any kind of slight anger really freaks me out. 

Besides that I know his friends don’t respect our relationship. For instance they may try and talk about women who they went to high school with in a sexual way around him. They will even pass around nude photos in a group chat. Number 1 I find that incredibly sexist and a complete invasion of those ladies privacy.

Thankfully I haven’t heard my SO be receptive and even asked me to go into his phone to delete a photo of a naked old class mate because he didn’t want to see it. Still. It gives me anxiety thinking about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to get that out. I feel a tiny bit better but not really. And no, I will not remove myself from the situation because I’d rather hear what they are talking about than be anxious not knowing&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"Hey guys. I've (22 male) been having some symptoms that I think could be anxiety or a culmination of stress or both.

I have had GAD (general anxiety disorder) my whole life, but only manifests when an event is associated with it. Only two events have happened that have triggered it. The first was when I was little. That issue was solved completely. The second was three years ago, after I spent a night without sleep. I associated anxiety with sleep and I still suffer today. Not as bad as most, I usually get 7-8 hours but sometimes I get 5 or 6 hours of sleep. I have never been given drugs or anything for it. But I manage.

Lately I have been having pretty bad brain fog (feels like I take ages to figure things out) and at night when I'm trying to sleep my thoughts of the day mix with my ability to sleep. For e.g. I'm build an app at the moment and last night my brain kept telling me to finish the app before I can go to sleep. Eventually at 3am I passed out because I was so tired. Also I have been waking up 2 to 4 times a night (I usually only wake up once to pee.). 

Other noteworthy things to consider... I am a developer so this year with covid have spent a lot of time indoors. I haven't been exercising other than walking for an hour every few days. And I just finished my final year at University last week (which was a crazy amount of stress on top of covid).

My Q is. Could my inability to relax when falling asleep and brain fog be caused by a culmination of the past year, covid, Uni etc? And should I consider meds for short term? And have any of year had similar symptoms from some sort of low-hanging anxiety

&amp;#x200B;

okay, ready?

&amp;#x200B;

alright.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a very stupid decision to watch exurb1a a few nights ago, in particular ""Sleep is just Death Being Shy"". This struck me with the horrible thoughts of death that I've not had since I was little, now come to the realisation that I'm going to die no matter what (which I actually knew before).

Because of that, the past few days have been agonizing and hopeless in that I have no control over it, that I was birthed into this world without consent and my only choice is to face the abyss ahead of me. It made me de-realize for several days, actually, wondering what the point of it all was if I was basically on death's waiting list.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's not death itself that frustrates me. As I said, I always knew I was going to die one day. It's the gut-wrenching anxiety that does it, how your mind spirals around, your breath sharpens and you can practically feel your heart pound against your chest as you think of a way, ANY WAY, to get out of your predicament. I wanna make peace with it before I do die, that I can pass on peacefully to... whatever lies beyond there. If there is anything.

The Caretaker's Everything at the End of Time elicited these same feelings of horror in me, that as I grow older I run the risk of slowly losing every memory I've ever made as I become a hollow shell of myself. And again, you can't really escape it outside of being put down.

Thus, it dawned on me the true horror of life. You're spat out into the world and given consciousness with no choice, the only thing certain that one day you'll be plunged into an abyss blacker than sleep without even realizing; either that or slowly unravelling into a drooling, useless shell of yourself. All of the struggles, with school and work and taxes seem... dwarfed, compared to the cosmic horror that awaits us all at the end, doesn't it?

Oh well. It is a while off, and you really won't recognise when you die. It's just making peace with it, and living life without fear.

They are slowly starting to come back together, but I am still struggling with something they said to me. Basically, ""We need to decide if we are still going to be friends with you or not."" I am keeping it intentionally vague because Its still really hard for me to talk about. 

But that has been something that has stuck with me for all these months. I am used to being in regular contact with my friends, it helps me feel reassured that I am important to them and they still care about me.

But it's hard when they wont write me back or reach out to me on their own. My rational brain keeps telling me that they're busy and not ignoring you, which I honestly struggle to believe. That has been something I am dealing with for most of the day, but its been very hard for me to keep myself even a little calm.

I can barely get myself to ask for a promotion at work that I&amp;#39;m 99% sure I&amp;#39;m going to get for quite a few reasons, simply because I&amp;#39;m too scared to go in and ask, but I need the money. It took all of my energy to get through the semester and even change my major, and I wasn&amp;#39;t even trying hard enough and had to drop a class just to get a decent enough GPA. But whats worse is that I know I have what it takes. I know I&amp;#39;m smart and I know I can work hard, I just feel like I&amp;#39;m not and that I can&amp;#39;t. I have to stop being anxious about these things in order to live but I can&amp;#39;t and it&amp;#39;s just so incredibly frustrating, especially because people don&amp;#39;t understand the anxiety I have about these things. They think it&amp;#39;s so easy to just pick up an extra shift or buckle down and do my work, and I know it should be but it&amp;#39;s not and I just can&amp;#39;t deal with it anymore. but I have to because that&amp;#39;s life, and I&amp;#39;m really trying to change my mindset and get things done. I feel like I&amp;#39;m being a baby when I talk like this but it had to come out for once, to people who might understand.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I've had what i can only assume is anxiety for a while now, and I recently talked to my doctor about medication. She prescribed me zoloft and after a few days I started to have the worst experience of my life. my skin was on fire, my body felt like I was touching a power line, I couldn't think, I was panicking more often then not, and I was away from home the whole time so I didn't have anything to ground me. I stopped taking it but even several weeks later my anxiety is still significantly worse than it was when I started and im mortified it'll never go back down. I got prescribed a new medication, venlafaxine, but im still really scared to take it. I've also been coping with a phobia of substances or intoxication or whatever. It took everything I had to have half a beer at Thanksgiving. That fear is largely from my experience with zoloft and obviously it is seriously inhibiting me from taking this new medication.

She prescribed me zoloft and after a few days I started to have the worst experience of my life. my skin was on fire, my body felt like I was touching a power line, I couldn&amp;#39;t think, I was panicking more often then not, and I was away from home the whole time so I didn&amp;#39;t have anything to ground me. I stopped taking it but even several weeks later my anxiety is still significantly worse than it was when I started and im mortified it&amp;#39;ll never go back down. I got prescribed a new medication, venlafaxine, but im still really scared to take it. I&amp;#39;ve also been coping with a phobia of substances or intoxication or whatever. It took everything I had to have half a beer at Thanksgiving. That fear is largely from my experience with zoloft and obviously it is seriously inhibiting me from taking this new medication.

I can be at home watching tv feeling anxious for no reason. I couldn’t say what I feel anxious about, it’s seemingly for no reason, just like a switch that is constantly on. I think I may have a generalised anxiety problem, however, it is worse in social situations. But it’s still all the time I feel anxious, regardless of situation.

I finally recently got medication to try and help. I was prescribed sertraline (Zoloft) 50mg 8 weeks ago and then moved onto 100mg. I think it has helped my low mood but sadly not anything for my anxiety.

,Anxiety,"My girlfriend was laid off for covid and has been searching for a job for about 3 months. She’s been trying so hard and as an introvert with anxiety it’s been very taxing on her. Anyway today she had a job shadow at a vet clinic. She was hoping they’d offer her the job today before she left but they said they’d been in touch in a few days. Which I find to be normal. But she is discouraged and anxious that it means she won’t be offered the job. She’s extremely qualified and the job shadow went great today. I think her hopes were up to get the offer on the spot and her anxiety is running out of control a bit that this means she won’t be getting the job. 
Can you guys say some things to reassure her that it doesn’t mean she isn’t getting the job?

,Anxiety,"I am conducting a research study in order to complete my doctoral degree on the benefits of martial arts in areas of depression, anxiety, stress, anger, wellbeing, and connecting it to qualities of self-transcendence and self-enhancement. I need not only martial artists but need non-martial artists as well.

I hope my research will provide further knowledge within the mental health field and show that martial arts can be an effective tool to cope with various symptoms. Although the internet has discussed its benefits, most websites base their facts on assumptions with no evidence or substantial reference. To support this, I am conducting research to hopefully fill the void and provide the support needed to show how martial arts is more than fighting, but about helping one’s state of mind.

I need people who do martial arts at any level and people who do not do martial arts, between the ages of 18-65. My goal is to gather data from 50 martial artists and 50 non-martial artists. The study will be completed entirely online through a survey and will take approximately 10 minutes.

There are minimal risks to this study, only that it may cause awkwardness and discomfort. However, all information will be anonymous, and no identifying information will be asked from you.

Your participation will do wonderful benefits to the martial arts and mental health community.

This research will be conducted by Joseph Kaufmann an Applied Clinical Psychology Student at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles.

Hello everyone,

I have a fear of being harassed, doxed, and canceled. I was always told to ""get over it"", but I couldn't. I tried finding something to do to distract myself (I now like making beats), but I was always constantly afraid whenever I thought of being canceled.

so when I was 13, I was always acting like a dick (I'm 14 now and I realized these mistakes). I commented some racist stuff out of anger (My mix of autism and ADHD could play a big factor in that) and I was always trying to do anything to fit in and 'be cool' by saying slurs that I didn't know meanings to. When I was 14, I cringed at myself for these types of things that I did. I'm afraid of having my life ruined by other pages on Instagram if you search ""exposing racists"" you will find plenty of them, which exposes kids and teens for irresponsible stuff (and mostly dox these teens, what school they go to, and their phone number, and in rare times, their home address). These pages also encourage people to harass the teens. I'm still stressing out and having anxiety to this day and I'm constantly procrastinating.

How do I get rid of this fear?",t2_8uh643o7,False,,0,False,Help!

There are a lot of different anxieties and mine mainly is hypochondria. For the people that do not know what this is; it basically means you are afraid to die because of some illness, cancer, ALS or whatever other disease you can come up with.

My main anxiety is and always has been a heart attack, ever since I got diagnosed with an anxiety/panic disorder 5 years ago.

It developed after a period of a lot of stress. Career-wise, financially but what messed me up the most was my then girlfriend of 6 years cheating on me.

I went through a few months of constantly thinking I was going to die in one way or another. I almost couldn't sleep, I was afraid to get a heart-attack in the shower and no one would find me. The panic attacks ofcourse were the worst but even when I calmed down my body kept being stressed and afraid.

It went to a point where I was afraid of taking the bus, being out in public, watching a movie in the cinema or even elevators. While watching a movie in the cinema (I was seeing a girl at the time), I looked where the exits were and basically didn't watch anything of the movie because i was so anxious all the time.

I decided to go to group therapy which luckily helped me quite a lot. I was told to do the things I was scared of. So eventually I did. I drank some redbull and started running around the neighbourhood to see if I would die of a heart attack.

PS: Don't use any medicines. Used Prozac for a month or two but some 'part' of me didn't work really well so I quit.

Eventually after a few months I got control of my mind and haven't got a real panic attack ever since. Still, my anxiety never went away.

This Hypochondria..... it sounds like some mythical beast I have to slay. Every few months it seems to randomise it's attack. Some months it hits me with being nauseous all the time. After he's done with that he will attack me with twitching body parts so it makes me think I have ALS. Then Some weeks of diarrhea or dizzyness.

Ofcourse the worst periods are the ones with pains in my higher abdomen or pains near my chest. Even though I know a heart disease probably would feel different, It still scares me.

This ofcourse takes a huge toll on your stress levels, especially if other things in life are not going that well either.

Right now I'm having these chest pains again but I still think that one day, If I ever get my life back on track, most of my anxiety problems will always go.

&lt;p&gt;PS: Don&amp;#39;t use any medicines. Used Prozac for a month or two but some &amp;#39;part&amp;#39; of me didn&amp;#39;t work really well so I quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually after a few months I got control of my mind and haven&amp;#39;t got a real panic attack ever since. Still, my anxiety never went away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Hypochondria..... it sounds like some mythical beast I have to slay. Every few months it seems to randomise it&amp;#39;s attack. Some months it hits me with being nauseous all the time. After he&amp;#39;s done with that he will attack me with twitching body parts so it makes me think I have ALS. Then Some weeks of diarrhea or dizzyness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse the worst periods are the ones with pains in my higher abdomen or pains near my chest. Even though I know a heart disease probably would feel different, It still scares me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ofcourse takes a huge toll on your stress levels, especially if other things in life are not going that well either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m having these chest pains again but I still think that one day, If I ever get my life back on track, most of my anxiety problems will always go. I will beat this disorder and so can you.&lt;/p&gt;

I've made a throw away for this just in case. Sorry for any bad formatting but I'm on mobile. 

I haven't had a panic attack for a long time but had one tonight for some reason. I think it's been building for a while because for the past few weeks I've been feeling a bit out of it (like I'm watching myself for a distance), and stammering when I talk. 

So tonight I had a total meltdown over something ridiculous. Once the initial panting, dizziness , and racing pulse had gone, I started struggling to get me words out and stammering really badly. Now, this is usual and passes pretty fast usually but for some reason, just when I thought it was getting better, I slapped myself in the face really hard! This happened about three times and then I managed to stop myself by slapping the furniture instead. It seems to have stopped now but does any one have any idea why I would have done this?

,Anxiety,"Hello,

I want to share a new experience that I've had, and see if anyone else has/is feeling the way I currently am. I am a senior in college pursing a degree which will place me into a high stress, high adrenaline, career path. For the past 20 years of my life, I've percieved myself to embody the passion and ability to be able to be able to work in these conditions, and with the experiences I've gained so far with an internship I've be able to he apart of, I continued to believe this was the case.

However, about three months ago everything changed. I decided to exercise (as quarantine has me sitting around) and found myself unable to bring my breathing, or heart rate, down to a resting level for the remainder of the day. Two ER visits over the next week left me with limited answers. I knew I didn't have covid, any serious emergency illnesses, or anything that was easily detectable.

Unfortunately, as the months have gone on I've noticed that these issues still persist. I am unable to any ""vigorous"" exercise without a sense of panic after the fact (during so is fine, its the afterwards that causes issues), low appetite (I never feel hungry and have lost LBs due to limited eating), along with random heart racing and the inability to feel like I can ""breath all the way"", especially when trying to sleep.

I've tried seeing a therapist, a counselor at my school, multiple doctors, and even some homeopathic remedies but these feelings and thoughts continue to persist. I do feel occasional relief, some days are good, some days are worse, but it always seems as if I have this constant ""entity"" watching over my shoulder ready to take me down at a moments notice.

I'm reaching out to anyone here to see if they've had an experience like me or some of the tips and tricks they've tried. I feel as my options are becoming more limited, like medicine, and due to my career field having a limited supportive view on mental health (especially medication), I want to try everything I can before that.

,Anxiety,"All my life I was pampered by my mom and because of that, I have not a care in the world with problems. Basically from what I was when I was a teenager, this is the same mindset I have.

Since I was a kid and up until now, My mom does all the work at home. She does all the laundry, she's the one who cooks food, basically she does everything and it makes me feel guilty and useless. Up until now this is the case and I haven’t improved.

By this time I should have been helping with the laundry, the dishes, the cooking, cleaning the house and everything else housekeeping related. I should have learned how to do “manly” stuff like fixing the sink, changing a car tire, going on adventures, learned to overcome my fear of heights, etc. Instead, I stay at home all day doing nothing but playing games, not talking with people, or hiding when people come to our house.

I am a picky eater and eat mostly unhealthy food. I only eat soft or comfort food which in turn didn’t make me any leaner and more muscular. I have a body of that of a frail little boy. I don’t have strong hands, arms or legs, I can’t run that fast and sweat easily. This is because I don’t exercise and don’t have a healthy lifestyle.

I spent my whole life just playing video games, watching too much anime, movies, Netflix, I had no goals in life, no direction, not thinking about the future. Because of that, It took me very long to finish a single course which took me 8 years. Gaming, Anime and Movies became my life instead.

I am not a people person at all. I hide when visitors come to our house. And because I have made this a habit, I am awkward when trying to approach a person and ask questions. I always get bullied and can become the laughing stock of the group.

I was lucky enough to land a job related to my career which was an electrician and but it involved heights and my fear of heights wasn’t helping, it also required some muscle like carrying big things and doing troubleshooting things and like I said, I have a frail body so basically I was useless.

Since I suck at being an electrician, they placed me over to do admin stuff related paperworks at the same company. Again, I had difficulty because all of there are so many variables to work with and I kept doing wrong things. The manager got so mad at me and I had to get tutored so many times by the staff and they started to hate me.

They put up with me until the end of my contract and were relieved that I was finally gone and replaced with someone with actual skill and someone who had the muscle and the brain.

Then I went freelance. I was able to manage it because they are mostly small businesses, not a lot of variables and was thinking this could be a good career. Then COVID happened and the instability of freelance affected me. I lost a client and then I started to panic and worry that we won’t be having any money left.

Now at this point I began to panic, all of this overthinking, my anxiety and depression was triggered and regrets and worries began to flood my mind.

I am experiencing:

\-heartbreak

\-palpitation of the heart

\-cannot sleep due to heartbreak and the palpitation

\-loss of appetite

\-slight chills

\-loss of passion to do the things I want and love

I keep asking myself what if I finished school earlier? What if I just developed my manhood instead of staying what I was when I was just a kid? Maybe I could have earned a lot more money and did not have to worry about our finances, my parents medication because they are now too old,

&lt;p&gt;I spent my whole life just playing video games, watching too much anime, movies, Netflix, I had no goals in life, no direction, not thinking about the future. Because of that, It took me very long to finish a single course which took me 8 years. Gaming, Anime and Movies became my life instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a people person at all. I hide when visitors come to our house. And because I have made this a habit, I am awkward when trying to approach a person and ask questions. I always get bullied and can become the laughing stock of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to land a job related to my career which was an electrician and but it involved heights and my fear of heights wasn’t helping, it also required some muscle like carrying big things and doing troubleshooting things and like I said, I have a frail body so basically I was useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I suck at being an electrician, they placed me over to do admin stuff related paperworks at the same company. Again, I had difficulty because all of there are so many variables to work with and I kept doing wrong things. The manager got so mad at me and I had to get tutored so many times by the staff and they started to hate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They put up with me until the end of my contract and were relieved that I was finally gone and replaced with someone with actual skill and someone who had the muscle and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went freelance. I was able to manage it because they are mostly small businesses, not a lot of variables and was thinking this could be a good career. Then COVID happened and the instability of freelance affected me. I lost a client and then I started to panic and worry that we won’t be having any money left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at this point I began to panic, all of this overthinking, my anxiety and depression was triggered and regrets and worries began to flood my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-heartbreak&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-palpitation of the heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-cannot sleep due to heartbreak and the palpitation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-loss of appetite&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-slight chills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-loss of passion to do the things I want and love&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep asking myself what if I finished school earlier? What if I just developed my manhood instead of staying what I was when I was just a kid? Maybe I could have earned a lot more money and did not have to worry about our finances, my parents medication because they are now too old,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I just told myself: I should have grown up.&lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have been fine all morning. I was comfortable and relaxed. I was a little bored but not to the point where I NEEDED to do anything about it. Content is a good word to use I guess. 

My boyfriend expressed he was super bored and suggested we go for a ride and get some food. I got all ready to go. I looked at the sky... white weather.... overcast, bright white color and the air just has an uncomfortable heaviness to it. I gave it a shot but I should have known better. 

We went through the drive thru at a McDonalds. The first thing that sent me into this downward spiral was the interaction between my boyfriend and the drive thru worker over the speaker. It seemed so loud and it hurt my ears ans head. I regrettably made a comment that could have been mistaken for me complaining and being rude so that made my boyfriend feel weird. That wasn't my intent. It just felt like that set the tone for the rest of the ride when i didnt mean it the way it came out. It just legitmatley hurt my ears because it seemed like they were raising their voices. I think maybe I am just super sensitive to loudness. 

So then we left McDonalds. In my head i assumed he was going to park so we could eat before it got cold. We got aways down the road and I asked whete we were going and he said, ""This way."" All of a sudden I just got really uncomfortable and agitated and my brain just went on overdrive. Every logical place to me where we could have parked he proceeded to pass and I didnt want to further damage the mood. I finally spoke up and he parked at a business that was open which made me uncomfortable. And then the next place was a place that was closed but he went out back and to me it just felt sketchy to park there. I finally couldnt take it anymore and told him i wanted to just go home. On the way home i had to shut my eyes and just focus on my breathing so i wouldnt have a full fledged panic attack. I was so uncomfortable with not knowing the plan or where we were going and was getting aggravated that the food was getting cold. 

I am so tired of my anxiety ruining everything for me. I cant even go on a normal drive with my boyfriend without this happening.

,Anxiety,"About a year ago I started knocking on wood (as a way to ward off bad luck) and I’ve become obsessed with it since then. Usually many many times a day but particularly at night time or when I’m using my phone (I use my phone the most at night before bed). Anytime I think of or see anything even remotely negative I have to knock on wood as to not feel distress. 
Scrolling down Twitter or listening to the news are particularly triggering but it’s also often just random negative thoughts popping on my mind. 

Sometimes I’m in bed about to fall asleep and suddenly I’ll think of something negative and I’ll need to stand up and go find wood to touch. Or I’ll be comfortably lying in the sofa, hear something in the TV and then I’ll have to move so I can reach the table and touch the wood. 

I’ve noticed the frequency of these cycles of negative thoughts and urges are getting more and more frequent and I’m worried and very frustrated that I can’t stop myself. 

Logically, I know that touching wood is not going to protect me or my loved ones from bad things but I’m not able to internalise this. 

Is this something that resonates with others? Is this some form of anxiety or OCD? 

Any suggesting on ways to manage this would be really appreciated!

,Anxiety,"So back in June I had a massive anxiety attack, first time it had ever happened like Iron Man 3 severe. Got diagnosed with Anxiety a couple month later Bradycardia(slow heart beat) because I kept having weird jolts of small pain and in my head I'd have them too thought it was a stroke or worse Aneurysm.

TW: minor mentions of blood and medical procedures

This post is long, and in two parts:

1. Dentist Prep
   1. A series of tips to make you feel more confident in your teeth before going to the dentist
2. My Standard Experience
   1. A step by step guide to a standard dentist appointment from my experience. I went to the dentist every 6 months until 18 and had braces (meaning an appointment every two weeks or so) for 2 years.

Dentist Prep:

1. Two Weeks Until Appointment
   1. Brush your teeth at least once a day
      1. My favorite time to brush my teeth is during my nightly shower. I will put my conditioner in, then brush my teeth before rinsing my hair. I know it is a little weird, but it fits well there during my routine.
      2. Another way I excite myself to brush my teeth is by indulging in my toothbrush and toothpaste. I have a kid’s toothbrush that is purple and blue with a suction cup on the bottom. Why? Because it makes me smile when I stick it to the shower wall. I also don’t like mint toothpaste. So I buy orange or cinnamon or berry. Who cares what flavor your toothpaste is, you know?
   2. Use mouthwash after every meal when possible
      1. Put mouthwash in every bathroom of the house and keep it visible. Every time you wash your hands you can use mouthwash. Having it accessible meant I was far more likely to use it.
      2. Along that vein, I like to keep one of those little TSA shampoo bottles filled with mouthwash in my purse or my car just so I can always freshen up after eating.
      3. I also like to buy ACT Mouthwash. Not only did my dentist recommend it for the fluoride, but their bottles have a fun self measuring mechanism that makes me happy.
   3. Stay hydrated
      1. A lot of people would say that you need to drink only water during this time and yes, in an ideal world, that would be great. This isn’t an ideal world and you are welcome to drink whatever you like - but just drink plenty!
2. One Week Until Appointment
   1. Continue all previous habits
   2. Floss every other day
      1. The first few times you floss, it is going to suck. Your gums will bleed and swell. Your lips will be sore. But once you learn how to maneuver the floss and your gums adjust, it will get A LOT easier.
      2. I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and I find those floss/pick/pipe cleaner things are super helpful in cleaning around the hardware 
3. Two Days Until Appointment
   1. Brush teeth for a solid 10 minutes
      1. This is another time that makes me really like brushing my teeth in the shower. If you aren’t about that, then plop on the toilet seat with a book and go to town. Find every nook and cranny - including your tongue. I usually re-toothpaste once or twice and will rinse whenever I need to.
   2. Floss for the last time before your appointment
4. Day of Appointment
   1. Brush your teeth in the morning
   2. Mouthwash and toothpick before appointment
      1. I like to do this to make sure I don’t have any of my lunch in my teeth or anything crazy. This isn’t the time to re-brush your teeth because the hygenist is going to do that anyway.

My Standard Experience

1. Arrive and Check In
   1. Usually there is a small lobby and a reception desk. First you will go to the reception desk and tell them you are here to check in. They will usually ask a few questions. If there is any paperwork you need to fill out, they will give it to you then.
   2. Next you wait. Now is the time to fill out any paperwork the reception gives you and return it when finished. Most people will just sit in the lobby and use their phones until their name is called. The reception will know the wifi password and are usually happy to give it out.
2. Walk Through to the Back
   1. A Dental Hygienist will, at some point, walk out and call your name. Go with them as they lead you to your appointment. The rooms are usually private so no one can see you during your appointment.
   2. If you brought your coat/bag to the back with you, there is normally an extra chair for you to set them on.
3. Sitting in the Chair
   1. Getting onto a dental chair seems like a tricky thiing, but it can be pretty simple.
   2. Sit down, butt first in the middle (usually the lowest point)
   3. Swing your legs over (either at the same time or one at a time) there are usually arm rests that are helpful to keep you balanced
   4. Lean back onto the slanted part.
4. Prep
   1. The hygienist will usually put a bib on you. This is to protect your clothes, but also as a tool wipe during the cleaning. Don’t worry, nothing they wipe on the bib will end up on you.
   2. While you sit in the chair, they are going to be pulling up your information and they might ask some questions (are you having any pain? How often do you floss? etc). Answer them honestly, they are not going to judge you. 
5. The Basics
   1. The hygienist will lean your chair back, possibly give you sunglasses, and pull a large light over your head.
   2. Now is when you are gonna open your mouth. Keep your jaw in a comfortable position and relax your face. I liken it to being halfway through a yawn, when your whole face goes lax. Try not to flex your lips or they will get sore quickly. If you need some, they always have extra chapstick!
   3. If you need to sneeze, cough, swallow, gag, etc. just put your hand up to catch their attention. If they don’t see you, tap them on the arm or shoulder. They are always happy to give you a break if you need one.
   4. Often they will give you small amounts of water. Treat it like mouthwash and swish it through your mouth for a couple seconds. Then you can either spit it into a sink or they have a suction straw that will pull out the water. You don’t need to swallow it.
   5. The suction straw is not powerful enough to hurt you. It can be a bit loud, but it is designed not to hurt you if you stick your tongue on it.
   6. Try to keep your tongue relaxed but out of the way of where they are working. Don’t freak out if you lick their hand on accident - it happens all the time! Why do you think their gloves are flavored? Lol
   7. Some places will have TVs mounted to the ceiling for you to watch. Some have Where’s Waldo posters, some have nothing. It is a bit of a grab bag. The hygienist will not notice what you are looking at. You can look at them, what they are doing, the ceiling, you can close your eyes, etc. I have actually fallen asleep during an appointment before and they don’t mind. If you would like, you can also put on headphones.
6. Cleaning
   1. First, the hygienist will go in with the metal scraping tools. This is to manually remove plaque that builds ups on our teeth. If you brush your teeth or you don’t, this is going to happen regardless! Plaque isn’t removed with a standard toothbrush in most cases.
   2. Next is flossing. The hygienists are incredibly thorough with this and it takes some time.
   3. The hygienist might give you options of what flavor toothpaste you want for the cleaning. Then they will go in to basically polish each tooth with an electric toothbrush. Periodically, they will have you swish and rinse water to clear out the toothpaste.
7. The Dentist
   1. Once the cleaning is done, the hygienist will call for the dentist. When they come in, they are essentially going to inspect your teeth. If you have any problems (mouth pain, tooth pain, wiggly teeth, etc.) let the dentist know and they will try to determine the cause.
8. Check Out
   1. Once this is done, the hygienist will put your chair upright, take off the bib, etc. and you are set to leave. Make sure to stop by the reception on the way out to make sure there is nothing else they need. Sometimes they need to confirm an address or ask if you want to schedule another appointment.

I hope that this can help you be more comfortable with going to a dentist appointment in the future! If anything I have suggested or written seems problematic, incorrect, harmful, or otherwise, please let me know!

    On August 13th we faced a tragic and shocking loss in our family and I wasn't sure I could ever feel happiness again. My aunt was found dead in a homeless encampment and I had to wonder if she was murdered, or raped, or both.how could her gentle soul and body be there without loved ones surrounding her? I had panic attacks every day and felt constant fear that something would happen to my other loved ones and I would not be able to take the pain. That if one more person I loved was to die I wouldn’t be able to live anymore. If one of my children died, I thought maybe I would kill myself- something I never admitted to my family. For so long the darkness of worry consumed me. I cried all day. I sobbed. I felt the world was spinning out of control. She was like a mother to me, and as I got older- a child to me. She was an alcoholic and struggled for decades. After 3 solid months of daily anxiety and darkness, I was able to feel peace and some sense of closure. The coroner’s report finally came back after being delayed by Covid autopsies. We found out that she died on her own accord, and somehow it made me feel better. She died of an overdose. I learned that whenever she left rehab she would do meth because it was cheap. I was shocked but somehow not surprised. She didn’t want to feel. Something in her life pushed her into numbness.

Frequent panic attacks. Just took half of Alprazolam (Xanax) to not feel this anymore. I have a hard time to enjoy things at the moment. Can&amp;#39;t enjoy a nice meal, don&amp;#39;t smile/laugh anymore, for crying out loud I&amp;#39;m on the sofa with my girlfriend and I can&amp;#39;t seem to relax. In less than and hour the meds should kick in. Let&amp;#39;s hope I find some relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already made an appointment with a therapist. But she&amp;#39;s very busy so my first session will be in about 2 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

,Anxiety,"I have been reading through a few of the posts of anxiety and I thought I would share some of my fun and games I go through on a daily basis. I had my first Anxiety/Panic attack in 2012, my brother passed away in a car crash and couple months later while I was on the way to work I witnessed a fatal car crash in front of me and since that day I have suffered from anxiety. Let me break down my different conditions for you all. Let me know if you can relate.

I think I have had every cancer known to man, if I get the slightest of pain in my stomach I think I have bowl cancer or iv just ruptured a ulcer and I’m on the verge of bleeding out. 

I hold all my stress in my shoulders which radiates to my neck which caused tension headaches and I instantly think I have brain cancer or I’m having an brain aneurism. 

And most famously I have been having heart attacks for the past 8 years.. this is by far the worst, I will get a pain in my chest and I will press it, I press it all day until I bruise and then press it more. I can not shake the fear of having a heart attack, I will spring out of bed as I’m falling asleep because I think one is starting. I just don’t know what to do about it. I am too afraid to exercise because i think it will cause a heart attack. I am too afraid to visit the doctor. I did many years ago and he said I had anxiety and I was put on medication which I took myself off because it was not doing much for me. Today I had a little chest pain and I have pushed it so hard all day that I have welted and bruised the area I just can’t stop. 

I live in constant fear of dying and it sucks. I also have a strange habit of hearing about an illness that someone got and then I will state mimicking the symptoms. I think I am a full blown hypochondriac. My wife is sick of it I am sick of it! I just wish I could fix this situation..

The red flags were there from a very young age when my friends told me they thought my dad was scary, but I just laughed it off and would say ""you're only dealing with him for an evening! I have to live with him!"" 

My parents were pretty strict with my upbringing. They're not religious, but they always seem to care how the family is perceived by strangers, and I and my younger brother had to be the outstanding model child of the school/town (which wasn't going to happen) and anything that could be deemed as embarrassing, they got very angry at. 

My dad also has had depression as long as I can remember and it has always been like walking on eggshells around him and, when I was kid/teen, my mum as well because she carried a lot of the everyday stresses and his woes as well.

I got bullied throughout primary and secondary school, and my parents reaction to it was always ""just ignore them"" other than one time in year6 my dad told me to say to a boy who was teasing me for the football team I like ""at least I go see my team"" and I was sent out of the class for saying it. I really hated school but I felt like I couldn't say anything to my parents because they got angry so quickly. 

They get scary angry at anything. We went to Canada when I was 7 and turned 8 while we were there and I remember sitting and crying in the corner of the apartment we were staying at because I felt so alone and separate from my parents I thought I must be adopted. They asked what's wrong and I told them this and they got angry and it made me feel 100x worse. 

When I was 10 we went to Majorca and I was terrified of deep water, and my dad carried me out into the sea to try show me it's ok, but I saw a plastic bag (which at the time I thought was a jellyfish) and I freaked out and screamed and kicked and swam back to the beach. My godparents who we had gone with were laughing but my parents were so angry in that moment I felt I had ruined the entire holiday. 

I'm not sure how old I was but it was younger than 11 I was constantly told I washed my face too quick in the mornings getting ready for school, but then I took too long washing my face, and apparently I just couldn't get it right in their eyes. So one day they told me when a friend came round to ask if I could come out to play I had to tell him no because I can't wash my face properly, which I did and then ran to my room in tears because I was so embarrassed. 

I grew up through secondary and college not wanting to invite people over because I knew how bad my parents could be even in front of friends. They'd call me into the next room over and have a go at me, saying I was showing them up, or showing off for my friends, when all I was doing was allowed myself to be myself around my friends.

I ended up hiding my true emotions at home and resented living at home, I was so envious of friends who had moved out to go to university or move away as I felt so trapped. I couldn't even do my hobbies. I couldn't sing in the house because my dad worked from home. I couldn't even have an electronic keyboard with headphones in because the keys clanking was too annoying. I bought a Ukulele which I sold within a week because I was too scared to play it with my dad around. I became a shell that sometimes exploded with anger because I got so frustrated. My parents would ""tease"" and ""wind me up"" but it was genuinely upsetting or frustrating most of the time and when I snapped back at it they told me I had anger management issues. I was a horrible person. 

My parents said to me on several occasions ""We love you, but sometimes we don't like you.""

At 18 I decided I'd set my own pet care business up (I did animal care at college and animals are my life) during the set up and the 4 years I ran it. My parents may have thought they were giving advice, but all it came across as was criticism. When I was first trying to figure out how to set it up my dad was so critical, I was too scared to ask for help. 

To this day, even though my dad will say he will help with website stuff if I ever need it, I am terrified to ask him for help because of his reaction. 

At 21 I could afford to buy and stable my own horse! This was my dream come true!! I was so happy, so thrilled! I was over the moon! I arranged it all myself I bought a thoroughbred mare who was absolutely beautiful (turned out to be a nutcase to ride but she was a beauty on the ground) and I came home one day with a saddle I had bought for her to ask my dad if he'd come up to the yard and take some photos of me with my new horse. My parents reaction haunts me even now. They destroyed my joy in a look. ""What have you done?"" They pretty much disowned me for a few days. I was heartbroken. This was the one thing I had wanted since I started riding at 4 years old and I had achieved it! And my dad said to me ""I bet you it won't last a year."" 

A final example will be my parents sat me and my brother down last May to tell us why they and our grandmother had fallen out about 5 years ago and they don't talk (this came up as I'm getting married and we were wondering about if they're going to be civil). My dad told us he had a bad childhood because his mom (said grandmother) left him and his brother with his dad and their step mum who was by the sounds of it like the wicked evil step mother. Now this certainly did clear up why they wouldn't talk to her anymore. The woman was a vile manipulative witch who had even manipulated me and my brother our entire lives (which is another reason I'm f***ed) but it also sounded like they were trying to give an excuse to their way of raising us. 

Now I have done phone call therapy, group therapy, one to one talking therapy, CBT, and now trying medication for a second time. But I have always blamed myself for how I feel. I have never wanted to place the blame on anyone else. But now I am looking back at everything that has happened to me and I can pinpoint the way I am now has a heck of a lot to do with my parents and the fear they instilled in me.

I feel like I am a scared little mouse that fears doing any wrong, fears bumping into certain people in the streets or a shop, fears ruining my partner's life, just fears everything.
