0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",depression,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
1,"Regular Check-In Post. Plus, a reminder about the No-Activism Rule.",depression,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  

********

Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.  It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support."
2,Not suicidal but just no desire to live each day,depression,"I don’t wanna end it all, but I’m just tired of living. Like each day kind of feels pointless. I feel exhausted just thinking about doing the same thing every day. I’m not happy and feel no purpose. It’s like I want it to be the next day, and the next day comes, and I’m wishing it was the next. I don’t know how to explain it. I’m just existing and not living. 

Am I going through a phase? Anyone else feel the same way? What helps?"
3,"Do what works for you even if it's ""weird""",depression,"I spent so long trying to fight myself to do things in a ""normal"" way. I did my homework at certain times a day, I brushed my teeth at certain time a day, I slept on a traditional schedule and felt really bad when I slept in late or stayed up late, I tried to eat at ""normal meal times"" and felt very bad when I was hungry at a time society deemed inappropriate.

 All that did was make me feel bad for struggling so hard to live life on a normal schedule, if I was able to do it at all. I'd be doing okay for a few days and then I'd have an episode and stay up until 7am and feel horrible or not brush my teeth floor a couple days because I couldn't make myself get up to do it before bed.

Now if I need to get something done, I do it when I want to. If possible, I do it after dark on a day I'm feeling up to it. I brush my teeth in the shower and whenever else I can make myself do it. I eat when I'm hungry, and do not eat simply because its lunch time. If I leave the house with the intent to do one thing and am asked to do something else but don't think I can make myself do it, I tell them I'm sorry but I want expecting to do that on this trip and I will do it separately.

Your brain is already making things so much harder for you, please don't let anyone make you feel bad for doing what works for you. I'm proud of you."
4,Zero Motivation for School,depression,"I’ve (21F) never been so unmotivated to do work for class. For the past month or even longer I’ve been sleeping or playing games to avoid doing schoolwork. I would turn in occasional assignments, but skip a lot too. I don’t usually do this. I’ve missed assignment before but not this much. 

I’m at the point where if I think about what I have to do I will just start crying and go lie in bed. I feel like I already gave up on school but if I do, I’ll postpone my graduation by a whole year. But I see no way for me to somehow do everything in the last 2 weeks of the semester. My logic tells me that I need to do certain things to pass class and be a good student but I can’t get myself to feel any urgency. 

In general, I don’t have the best grades, but I’m not a complete slacker either, not until now. The only time I don’t feel upset is when I either accept that I gave up, or ignore school. But, I love the major I’m in, and what I could be doing post graduation. I have an internship lined up in the summer. I would hate myself if I ruined my life because of this. 

Some things I’ve done already to try to help, but it hasn’t (yet anyway).
-Talked to a counselor at my university 
-Get a small part time job to make me go outside since classes are online
-Confide in my boyfriend a ton

What am I supposed to do to feel the urgency to do work again?? FYI, I am back home, finishing the semester off online. I thought a change of scenery would help but it didn’t. I really just want an excuse to tell people why I’m slacking.  Like an accident or something. I get anxious thinking that people will look down on me. And I’m mad that I’m not meeting my own expectations too. 

I’m just hoping for something big to just smack me out of this before I fail all my classes this semester."
5,That feeling inside your chest,depression,"It’s a heavy feeling. It’s kind of like an ache, or like heartburn, and it’s so physical that you start to wonder if you actually did eat something bad. You can’t help but notice it, and even though it hurts, it’s hard not to lean into it. When you indulge the feeling, all the Bad Thoughts come rushing forth. Maybe you’re sad, or angry, or feeling guilty. Self pity is usually in there somewhere. Sometimes it makes tears prick at the corner of your eyes. You try to distract yourself from the feeling by taking up space in your head with anything else. It’s always sort of there in the background. But sometimes it actually subsides, and it feels like such a relief, like you’re free and you can breathe again."
6,Seeing a psychiatrist for the first time tomorrow and I'm so scared,depression,"I (F20) have my first appointment at psychiatrist tomorrow. My mom accidentally saw my scars and decided to get me a help. But I'm so scared. What if I'm gonna just waste their time, what if I'm faking it? I know I have really bad moments and it's been happening for about 4 years now. I have no energy to do stuff,I'm feeling down every day and I've been selfharming for a year straight. But I don't think I'm sick enough to get help. I don't think they'll see me as someone who needs their help. I don't even know what should I talk about to them.
Also I've been doing a bit better last few days, I'm 5days clean eventho I had bad urges to selfharm. So I think they won't take me seriously."
7,I accidentally destroyed my friend's mental state because they tried to help me,depression,"So here I am, venting to strangers on Reddit. 

I have a lovely friend that's almost as messed up as I am, and no less than twenty minutes ago, I found out that because they tried to help me, I've destroyed they're mental state. I should have just kept my walls up. I don't know what to do. I'm just running again. I'm going to just pretend I'm happy because everyone only likes when I'm happy and making jokes. I'd be saving so many people if I just shut up and pretended to be fine. Life doesn't feel worth living and I feel like I'm just better off dead."
8,"The worst thing is watching the world go by and seeing other people progress, but you feel helpless and cannot do anything...",depression,"It sucks knowing that so many people out there in the world are getting their ""first break"" or attaining their dream career, aspirations and goals, and yet somehow you are stuck in a rut and cannot even get yourself to do the basic necessary things required to be a competent human being.

The problem is only compounded by the fact that there is a global pandemic, mass unemployment for hourly workers, and despite your best efforts to gain meaningful employment and even attempt self-progress, it is only met with futility."
9,I'm homeless now,depression,"Because I ran away from abusive parents. Never thought I'd actually do it but here I am. I don't want to return. There it's pure hell. It's agonizing to live there. Now I am outside and I will live on the streets. My number one fear became alive. It's incredible how fears and the thing you don't want most to happen actually happen. Life is hell. Life is torture. I don't know what the fuck i will do from now on. Guess I'll be what I feared to be the most. That's it.

EDIT: I took the decision on impulse and I realized that it's impossible to do this on this time of the year. I'm too weak so I gave up. I'll try to calculate my possibilities and think through how I can leave this cursed house. I already regret giving up but what can I do. If I can't find any shelter to get away from here I will try to apply for uni dorm in the next semester. Unfortunately, the country I live in is shit and has little to no possibilities for those in disadvantaged situations. Abuse is considered normal here.

Thank you everyone for the support and advices, it means a lot to me.

EDIT 2: I'm from Romania."
10,To girls in toxic relationships,depression,"I was in a relationship with a guy for 2 years. I really thought he was the one, but throughout the entire relationship I was extremely depressed and at my lowest. During that relationship, I even found myself in a psyc ward for attempting suicide. We broke up because one day I just decided I wasn’t happy in the relationship and I felt that he wasn’t really benefiting my life. It was extremely hard at first. Now, we have been broken up for over 10 months, I don’t take medication anymore, and I don’t often find myself sad or suicidal for days on end (of course I still experience some symptoms of depression, but it’s drastically improved since the relationship ended). All I’m saying is if you’re in a relationship, definitely evaluate yourself in the relationship and consider if it’s something that is worsening your mental health. I genuinely wish I had evaluated my relationship sooner than I did."
11,What is normal?,depression,"I don’t know what it feels like to be normal. I lost whatever definition of normalcy is, months ago. I haven’t felt like myself in so long and it’s fucking scary. I have no motivation to do anything except drown in my thoughts and occasionally watch tv. When I’m around people, you’d never be able to tell because I don’t want people judging. Every now and then I’ll be zoned out at work and someone asks if I’m okay and I’ll lie. I’m not fucking okay. I want my life back. I want ME back."
12,Not finding joy in things you used to love doing is such an awful part of this,depression,"I just realized that I don’t sing anymore. I used to sing all the time. Even when I wasn’t very good I would still try to pull it off. My coworkers, family, they all liked it because it showed that I was having fun, and it helped lighten the mood. Or at least that’s what they told me.
But I just realized today when I was driving home that I was listening to music and not singing along. And that I hadn’t in awhile. I started up just for the heck of it. But before the song was over I stopped. I just didn’t care to sing anymore. And the sound of my voice made me feel gross.
Anything like this happen you y’all?"
13,I don’t belong anywhere,depression,"I don’t fit in and I don’t know how to fit in, I’m fake, I’m hiding, I’m never telling the truth, I’m just fucking my brain up for such a long time. No one knows me really, I don’t know myself anymore, it’s been so long, I’ve been faking my personality for so fucking long.
I’m so useless, a nobody."
14,i wish there was a way to die without hurting anyone,depression,"i don't want to be alive. i make everything worse. my family is happier when i am gone. my friends don't care. my fiance doesn't understand and im too much for him. i am cold and rude and terrible at communication and conflict. i don't perceive the future being good or happy or any different from today. i don't know why tomorrow will be any better.

but ive already hurt people enough. i don't want to hurt them again but selfishly i wish i was dead."
15,I got a job interview finally,depression,Lost my job because of mental health issues 2 months ago and have been struggling just to feed my girlfriend and my dog but I hope this will be promising..wish me luck
16,70+ years of this shit,depression,"I cannot fathom the idea of doing this for 70+ more years. Just no way. 70 years of dreading going to work, pretending to be enthusiastic whilst there, then being too tired to do anything once I get back? 

I can’t see myself with a romantic partner, so I will be alone for the next ??? years while this is happening... holy shit I just can’t."
17,I feel like I'm losing my mind a little every day but no one understands how bad it is,depression,"I've been depressed for the majority of my life, since I was about six years old and now I'm 20. I've been on medication for about three years and its helped me a lot, but I feel myself slipping away again. 

I graduated in June 2019, I started working at Burger King before I graduated so I would have something to do afterwards. It was shit conditions, so much stress and  not getting payed well, but it was at least a job. I managed to find another job at a call centre as tech support for one of the biggest TV companies in Sweden. This job was also shit but better than Burger King. But I didn't want to go to work, I would go to the toilet and wish for the time to go faster. Customers would call us idiots, yell at us and call us all the names in the book. On top of that we had a lot of pressure from our boss. No call should be longer than 10 minutes, during that time you hade to register the ticket while talking to the customer and we had to sell them things aswell. No matter how well we did we could always do better. Once again I have a new job which is amazing. But I feel like the stress from this and last year is taking its toll on me. I haven't been unemployed since I left school and I haven't had more than 3 days off at the same time (besides some weekends) and I'm losing my mind. 

I want to quit, I feel like I cant live anymore. Sometimes I cry between calls I take because I feel so overwhelmed. I have an amazing boyfriend but he doesn't really know how bad it is. My mom knows me but she doesn't either really know how bad I feel. I try to stay strong for them but I don't know for how much longer I can do that. I have a doctor I go too and a psychologist. I told the doctor that i often forget words, cant sleep properly, have lots of anxiety and slur on words quite often. So far we've taken like 5 blod samples but nothing really sticks out. 

I'm tired of feeling like shit, I'm trying to get help but it doesn't feel like its going anywhere. My boyfriend doesn't really understand but he does his best which I appreciate. I don't want to talk about it too much either, I don't want it to come off as complaining and annoying. 

I feel like if I quit my job for a month or two, maybe that's enough time for my body and mind to rest so I can start working again or study. Or I work now and save money so I can study much sooner. I don't know what to do, I dont want to let anyone down but I feel like I'm at my breaking point. 

Just needed to get it off my chest. 

Thanks if you read this far"
18,I just wish I wasn't depressed anymore,depression,School life and getting bullied and all are too overwhelming for me
19,I literally don't know how I'm feeling,depression," A majority of the time I don't know how or what I'm feeling. For the most part I'm apathetic and unfeeling, and I'm just in this constant state of ""nothingness."" I'm not happy, or sad, or anything really."
20,I can't accept the fact that life didn't go as I planned.,depression,I'll never have what I wanted and I don't understand how can I keep living if I'll have nothing good in my life anyway.
21,How am I suppose to get better when I can't even get my stomach full?,depression,"I'm fucking hungry. 

Sad and hungry. 

Angry and hungry. 

empty and hungry.

""It will get better"" huh. BS."
22,Loosing my mind cant keeep doing this,depression,Im going insane idk what to do anymore noone wants me around noone loves me im different so im not as good as everyone else. feel so seperated from the world i dont belond here i just want to die. Escape this hell we call life what is the point theres nothing i want to do. I try hard and never succeed it kills me inside noone around me knows what goes on in my head how crazy there making me go. Im not allowed to do anything everything i do they never appreciate it ive felt like ive actually done something but noone else does im just not good enough. No friends no loved ones never had a loved one just me bymyself in this lonely cold fucking world i just want to die and end it all.
23,Been thinking about this for a while,depression,Every path you take leads to death.
24,I made my sister stop calling me,depression,"The last person to give any fucks about me, well done, now you’re finally all alone. No one to call, no one to talk to. Well fucking done. 
And the worst thing is I’ve said some awful stuff, just to make her go away. A sad lonely person who is mean to people just because she can’t deal with them. I just want to disappear, I’m too awful to exist."
25,I just want people to recognize me,depression,"I don't know how to open up to people. I just can't be vulnerable with my feelings to people in real life. It makes me angry with myself, I'm a fucking piece of shit nobody freak show loser. Fuck me I fucking hate myself, stupid fucking idiot. Please just someone out there know that I'm suffering and I'm in pain and I don't know what to do."
26,Psychologist asked me what my inner child looks like. I drew this.,depression,"Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time). I described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside. She wants to leave the room but she knows it's safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave.

I drew [this](http://imgur.com/a/wIEFpRw) afterwards. I can't draw, but I hope someone else can relate to it."
27,Damn i really thought i was a normal human being huh,depression,Hahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahgagahahahahagahahgqgqgagagaggagagagagagagaghqhahahahahshshejjejejrjrjrjrjrjrjeiei2i2k2 im going fucking crazy in this place
28,It’s an endless cycle,depression,"I just want to say that if you feel like you’re in an endless cycle, you’re not alone. I can’t speak for everyone but I can most certainly speak for myself when I say: ITS TIRING. It’s mentally and physically exhausting to have to go through the same motions day in and day out. Waking up, asking for a better day, working and then getting off work only to try and find my solutions through drinking. I’m constantly wondering if my future will be fruitful. Constantly wondering if the love of my life will ever love me again. Constantly wondering if I’m good enough. 

I hope you all know that even though our situations may be different, there is someone who is going through the same cycle. It’s not deserving, but let’s hope in time this will all have a reasoning."
29,Tired.,depression,"I’m so tired of living each day sad...
I don’t know what to do anymore I just want to end my existence. I am done fighting"
30,i wish my mom had gotten through with the abortion,depression,"reason im pro-choice, born into this shitty world."
31,"Whenever I tell people about my feelings, they always say that I am being dramatic.",depression,"Then they ask me why I'm not very open to them.

(What's wrong with this world?)"
32,I'm gonna get graduated from college in 3 days and I don't feel happy at all.,depression,"In 3 days I have to discuss my thesis and get my college degree.

Everyone I know, my family and friends, they are all happy about it, but not me. This year has been a nightmare, I struggled in passing my last exams because I couldn't learn shit. I attended a 3 month intership that was awful and left me a huge psychological wound, and now every time I think about it or that I'm gonna do coding for a job for the rest of my life just makes me sick both physically and mentally. I'm not good at it, I don't enjoy it, I don't want to do it. Stop making me believe that I'm smart of some shit because I am not. I can't even talk and express myself properly, I keep forgetting everything even simple chores or stuff I was used to do. I'm tired and sick of everything.

I already refused two job interviews in the past weeks because they were finding a junior developer. I don't know what te fuck I'm gonna do and I'm fucking scared of my future because people will expect a lot from me and I can't almost do shit without having a massive headache. I asked  my parents to get help with therapy or some shit since july but they don't care, they are not helping me and I can't talk anymore to them because they will only judge me saying that ""I'm just lazy"".

I feel completely burden and not proud of myself in any way.

I had to abandon my studies when I was still in time."
33,Guilty with depression,depression,I feel so guilty for being so down and unhappy because there are people in such worse circumstances than me that are happy. But I’m so depressed and can’t get out of my funk
34,Struggling against my mind,depression,"I am not actually clinically depressed. I think I am going there. What I have is 'anhedonia' . That being loss of interest in things which I used to enjoy. It's a core symptom of depression. Although many people  experience anhedonia without having depression. It's been two years. Two years. I never noticed it. Recently I started to notice that I am loosing interest in many things since last two years. I don't have any reason to be depressed, I thought deeply, nah , no reason to be depressed. 

I don't believe in medication as these things can worse the situation . I watched those motivational videos on youtube, where they say I have to be mentally tough, I have to do things even I don't like to do. So I am doing things I don't like to do. I am going to bed at 11:30 pm and waking up at 5:30 am in the morning. I am doing meditation. I am doing 40 minutes of weight lifting. Making my own bed, cooking my own food, going outside even if I don't like. It's like I am at war with myself. Btw I'll continue this war against my mind. Let's see if this war can cure my pre-depression situation. 

You guys can give it a shot. Going in a war against yourself, it's freaking crazy man."
35,"Clinic ""rules"" hurt me",depression,"Aight I'll make it quick. 

I am in a clinic because of my depression. I had to give a urine example today because they do drug tests, but there is always someone in the room with you. Thats a rule. 
I tried, but my stress level goes so high when a man is standing directly behind me I cannot pee. It just doesn't work because my anxiety goes wild and the stress aswell. I told them so and they said:
""Okay. So your test is positive if you don't do it"" 
Now they are taking away my phone, cigarettes, my time where I could go outside and see friends, they say I'm doing everything wrong and basically blaming me for not being able to pee in a fucking cup... everything. 
Just because I get anxious and stressed when I have to do the urine test. 
Is this right???"
36,How did you all get through highschool?,depression,"It’s my senior year and I’ve lost all motivation. I have no college plans, I have no job. The one thing I really ever wanna do is get a job and start working. But I’m just caught in this school against my will. 

I’m failing every one of my classes, I’m not stupid, there’s just so much missing work and I just have no motivation to do it. I see nothing for me. After three years of busting my ass for this system I have nothing to show and no dreams to hold. 

When does it get better? Or am I just doomed to repeat senior year?"
37,"I suddenly have not just 1 plan, but 2",depression,"One for the warmer months, and a faster one if its too cold to spend time outside. I may not plan to be dead tomorrow yet I wish I would be."
38,"don't know if this is depression, but i think it would be without my new toxic coping strategy",depression,"so

in the bad times of my life

i have always used different coping strategies

sometimes ive combined them, sometimes ive developed new ones

let me make a list
- eating (i was obese for a long time)
- drugs (i used over 30 different substances, some of them were a habit, including benzodiapenines and opiates)
- stealing (i went stealing stuff from stores when i felt bad, sometimes little, sometimes large things. i got pretty good at it, until i got caught over a stolen nuisance, and never triedagain)
- video games (i was horribly addicted to them at one point)
- exercise (after my time of obesity, i started doing sports everyday, working out often until i almost passed out over months. when i could not exercise due to injury i felt useless and depressed)

so ive tried all of these, and now its covid, and i think i found a new, very toxic way to cope: tinder. seriously, this is so toxic, i have a hard time writing about it. the secret to not being afraid of rejection, of not having to wait for texts, is to have an entire queu of girls who are waiting to text to you. its fun, its real fun, but i noticed recently how obsessed i've become with it. if i would have to stop today, there would be nothing left, i am already feeling like shit most of the time, without tinder, without the women i text and meet, there would be nothing left.

i know that this is toxic, wrong, and i should probably be ashamed of what i am doing. but returning to drugs is not an option, it is too cold to exercise outside and i am injured, stealing is not an option aswell as i do have a record, and i will never return to gaming.

fuck"
39,I feel like I don't deserve people,depression,"Idk why but I think I really need therapy, ever since I was a kid i was always lonely and it was mostly because of family issues that made me isolated from everyone else. My parents always fought and eventually the unfortunate happened and I tried to make myself stronger by being resilient but I just ended up making a huge gap in my life. I've never felt cared or Its more like 'i could never feel what's it's like to be cared for' and if I do my mind goes in a frenzy like it's my first time being cared for. So If a person really gets close with me or If I feel that they're close with me Im so inclined to just be with them cause of my lonliness that Ive felt for all of these years 

I tell people about this and they say the lonliness is temporary but it isn't; it's never been temporary it's always been here for my whole life and the shitty part is I can never do anything about it. The need for people (ik this is getting dramatic,but I just feel like I saying it) is like my new form of happiness; it's pathetic and I feel disgusted but I just don't know what else can make me happy.Being this lonely just made want people so much that I don't require anything else and it's just I'm dying in the inside everytime someone leaves or is gone for even like a second. One solution is make new friend or grow your circle but I'm afraid I'm just gonna fuck up things for others.

I feel toxic and I feel like an ass, people have their lives and who am I to interfere? Who am I to expect people to be there for me? Isn't it there life?...I want to go for therapy I really do but I can't understand what I've become. I know this might look too dramatic or cringe maybe but I feel like dying everyday and it's so much sometimes.sorry if you can't understand it it's just something I wanted to get off I suppose and I get the anonymity helps in doing it here."
40,Looking for help,depression,"I’ve been in the worst rut the past several weeks. I mostly just try not to be conscious and I’ve fallen so far that I literally don’t know what to do. 

This sounds absolutely ridiculous so I made a throwaway account just for this post, but can somebody please help me literally just make a list of how to function. 

I’m talking painfully simple, things like get out of bed and stretch for 5 minutes x amount of times per day, brush your hair, sweep the floors, keep a tally of water consumption, brush your teeth/hair, idk maybe set an alarm ever so often and just turn the TV off and leave my bed for even just a few minutes. Bonus points for things that can help me get out of my head like read ten pages in a book or a guided meditation or I don’t even know.

I’m in pain, Ive gained weight, I look terrible and I can feel my body deteriorating along with my mind and as embarrassing as it is, I need somebody to just list for me how to function. I know I’ll feel somewhat better when I start taking care of myself again but I’ve been in this bed so long I really just forgot how to be."
41,I accidentally landed in a psychiatric hospital. AMA.,depression,"My psych prescribed me very potent drugs, I went out of my mind and self assigned myself in the hospital."
42,I feel like I'm about to go back to self harm and meds after 6 months of holding back,depression,I was dealing with depression and anxiety bouts okay although sometimes I was very close to cutting and even suicide attempts. But today it's one of those days where I want to give up the fight. Idk how to cope with this right now. I don't even have the tears to cry but I really want to and it's the worst.
43,What Are Your Telltale Signs Things Are Getting Bad Again?,depression,"the pandemic has been ...very tough on me, as it has for everyone I’m sure. but recently it’s gotten harder to get out of bed, harder to reach out to friends, harder to sleep. I normally know things are getting really bad again because 1. I’ll start justifying not brushing my teeth one night, and then that turns into twice a week, and eventually it’s every other day - gross!!! 2. Either I’ve stopped listening to music completely or I listen to the same (no exaggeration) 4 downer songs on repeat, when normally I can be kinda pretentious about the music I listen to lol 3. I stop cooking/baking which I like doing more than anything 4. My water intake decreases, normally I am very well hydrated but nothing tastes good when I’m sad and definitely not water 5. The BIG one. I know things are really bad when I don’t even have the energy to smoke weed. Weed is the only thing that really helps me physically and mentally and if I can’t even get myself to roll a joint I know something needs to change. 

what are your guys signs? do you force yourself to do these things or just allow yourself time?"
44,I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser.,depression,I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. Rinse &amp; Repeat. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. I. Am. A. Stupid. Loser. Etc. Etc. Etc.
45,Looking back,depression,"I have reached that place in life where you look back on your childhood wishing to return.
I always hated being a kid while I was a kid like many I imagine. 
For me even as a kid I self isolated and didn’t really enjoy life. 
Even tho I had no friends I had my family which was everything to me.

It’s not the same anymore.

You get older and more aware and realize no one is who they say they are. My family it ate up with mental illness to the point it was necessary to cut off half of them. Manipulative, harmful and poisonous. The rock I had before my adulthood turned out to be sand.

It’s very sad reminiscing
What is it like to be confidential yourself and those you grew up around?
What is it like to be born happy?
What excuse is there to exist.

Better to have never been."
46,Update: It’s been 2 months living without the love of my life,depression,"Since the day I lost my late girlfriend, I think of her every day in my lonely thoughts.

That feeling haunts and curses me every time I get to this point. It's like seeing and hearing an imaginary ghost of her. It traumatizes me a lot.

 *A couple of weeks earlier* 

I tried to sleep and she was on my mind, I cried desperately and got out of control.

I've gone for a walk and she comes to mind, I freak out and scream.

I showered and heard her voice, got aggressive and damaged myself to snap out of it.

I love her and wanted the best future of our lives, but when she died I just want to cease to exist, the pain goes too far, I hardly breathe, keep cursing, become aggressive and go in despair.

I just want/wanted to be loved again."
47,Recently...,depression,"Recently I have been getting high and doing everything I can to avoid my problems, because when I do I get so depressed and thinking about it makes me wonder whats the point of living. Its almost like get high/do something or kms in my head."
48,It's Hard Knowing No One Has Ever Liked You,depression,"It's hard being the lonely person in the friend group. It sucks to be the person everyone just feels pity for because you've never been in a relationship before. It sucks knowing that no one has ever seriously liked you. It's sad hearing people say ""Oh you just need to put yourself out there and you'll find someone in no time"" slowly turn into ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually"". Having to hear advice like ""You need to have a more positive outlook"" as if a positive outlook is going to make my tinder profile or anything else more attractive and desirable to anyone. I'm just tired of being the ugly person, the person people just feel bad for. I just wish there was someone in my life who liked and cared about me in a romantic one. Just once."
49,I'm tired,depression,"Like not physicly but I always am tired im just sick of it all im just ready to go im only 14 and pepole say I dont understand what life is like but I think i have got the jist
Wageslave for about 50 years then die 
I can either die alone at the age of 70 in a hospital or i can die alone in my garage at the age of 14 
I die alone either way, with joy being a distant fucking memory"
50,"So, I'm a Sociopath",depression,"Your kind of just empty inside, you can't laugh, cry, or feel emotions that aren't just some built up character you've made for yourself.
You feel like a narcissist all the time. Apart of you hates every imperfection outside and inside, metaphorically and literally. As a kid, you were probably singled out for behaving in a socially unacceptable manner or found yourself alone with no actual friends who aren't just acquaintances from work and happen to stick around.

You can't help but make comments and statements in your head. Arguing with yourself and some pointless argument you had earlier with some random on the internet. But you were too out of it to say it quickly or had to go back to work. You spend most of your time fantasizing and painting a perfect world thats only in your head, while criticizing everything about it, along with everyone around you. 

You become a Loner, you think you have depression and want to kill yourself. But really you want to lash out against a world you feel is wrong. Like everything in it is poison, and instead of killing you it's slowly choking you and making everything as uncomfortable as possible. So you match what your feeling on the inside and push people away. And when you're at your peak. You get more self destructive and can't stop.

Suicides not the option, when it's just being angry at yourself for not being the idealized vison of your perspective of perfection. Its best to just lash it out with yourself instead of the people around you. But you can't help it, you know you shouldn't but its the part of you that wants everything to be perfect.
Once you accept that part, its just the beginning.

Because you still feel empty and nothing fills the hole inside. Your living with every imperfection, its what normal people do. No matter how shitty or cringey it was of any number of the things that you could've done. You get to continue going for that perfection and overcome that. Thats the hard part, because the world won't be the one you picture in your head. 

That's where you fall back into the cycles of repeating mistakes which will then become choice, or you can break them. But you'll always be tempted to fall back into the routine. Even doing drugs, drinking and sleeping with strangers, won't fill that hole. Its a temporary escape, making excuses for why you didn't do any of the things you at some point wanted to do. The regret being the biggest imperfection that is being unable to accept the outside world. 

Its a cycle that won't stop, but you can minimalize your damage to others by just focusing on your own issues. Even if it means your all alone, repeating the cycle of hating yourself and temporarily escaping any way you can. 

I still can't stop myself from being cruel to others, but its not an easy thing to do. Breaking the routines and habbits you hate are the only real goals you should be focused on. But its work, like anything else in life."
51,Post pandemic loneliness is bringing up suicidal feelings.,depression,"Obviously the past few months has been shit for everyone . being a depressed person that usually isolates himself I thought quarantining and less social activity would be great . its right up my alley. WRONG. Months later I feel completely socially deprived and taking care of myself has become a struggle. It's not that I can't be  friendly  or social it's that anxiety just makes it difficult. With everything including groups being closed I've done nothing but work and go home. Its crushing knowing your contact with people is limited when your struggling. This year I couldn't meet up with friends like usual for thankgiving, no summer fun,  family holidays just didn't happen. 

I never realized how much those things mattered until now . as of the beginning of the year i was making huge improvements but this whole covid situation has brought things back to me being at my worst. Making friends, building relationships and being part of a community is all on hold for now.The repeat process of limited contact and being stuck between work and home is making me feel like its not worth going on. Its not that I want to die but I just can't deal with the current situation and don't know another way out . Downward spirals in depression have become much easier .  I'd literally pay somebody for a hug or a few hours of random conversation at this point."
52,Total and complete loneliness,depression,"The time of the year that i am dreading the most is getting close and i do not know what to do...

A bit of my background.

As a kid i moved between countries a lot because of my parents' work and at first i loved it however I never managed to make any real friends...

When i turned 18 i came out to my family as gay, but no one accepted me, the environment was just too hostile to live in, being threatened every day was just so exhausting and i decided to leave my home and country and try to find happiness elsewhere, while keeping very little contact with my family.

I am 26 now and in the last 7 years i moved quite a bit, for University, work, ex boyfriend etc, and last year i had to move back home in order to fulfill my national service in the army... unfortunately it still is obligatory and if i dont do it, i will have problems renewing my passport or re-entering the country. It was a horrible experience, because the army is just so homophobic and i had to hide who i am in order to keep my physical integrity...

The very next day of finishing the army, i started looking for a job outside my country, i got through many interviews and by July i actually got an amazing job offer in Barcelona/Spain. I did not hesitate at all, took it straight away and i moved to Barcelona in September. Now it's been just over 2 months that i am here, the current situation with Corona has not allowed me to make any friends at all, i have met people but i know none of them actually consider me a friend and everytime i messaged them and suggested to meet up for something, its always the same asnwer ""yeah sure, i will let you know"" and i can see on social media they go out a lot but never invite me... Even before Corona i found it hard to make friends... they just never seem interested enough to invite me for anything...

So....

All i do now is work from home and then either go for a walk or spend the rest of the day in my room watching Netflix or a little bit of gaming on my pc.

At first i loved going for walks as it helped me clear my head and exercise but now it only makes me feel worse, i go out and all i see is people in groups, friends, couples, families and i am walking between the crowds feeling like a shadow, like i don't exist.

Sometimes the emotions become so hard to hold in so i will go somewhere isolated so people don't see me crying.

Now we are less than a month away from Christmas and all i can see is my ""friends"" on Facebook and people that i have chatted to here in Barcelona making plans with friends and family and Christmas is just a reminder that i will be spending it completely alone and that i have no one. I share a flat with some other people, however 2 of them moved out last week and the last one is moving home for Christmas so i will be completely isolated for few weeks...

I wish i had someone who cares about me. Someone who wants to get to know me, a friend that i can talk to when i feel down, someone to tell me everything will be alright, someone to just give me a hug and let me feel some warmth because i don't remember the last time i felt loved or welcome anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

It getting so much harder to keep going, i want all of it to stop, i do not know what to do anymore."
53,oh well,depression,nothing’s been going right recently. i have no more weed to fuel my drug addiction so i’m gonna come down from this high pretty harshly and i’m about to give up. i normally just joke about killing myself but this time i think i really mean it. i hate going through the same cycle of emotions every single day. idk what to do and dont expect anyone to be able to help me because i’ve probably heard it all before. i just need someone who is gonna be able to send my note out to the right person when the time comes. can anyone help?
54,"[L][20F] I need to talk with someone, please",depression,"I really need to talk to someone, please. I am in a terrible mental state and need someone that I can talk with, I barely have any friends, and my family isn't good, so I have no body to talk too."
55,What do you guys really think happens when we die?,depression,"I honestly think it’s just black...zero consciousness. That’s what’s scariest about killing myself. What will happen on the “other side”. I tried making this life work and I’m really gonna miss some people if I do it. The issues I have are things I can’t even control (height, IQ, and looks). At least if I was fat I’d be able to work hard and change it."
56,Holiday Depression/Anxiety without knowing really why,depression,"I almost always have a terrible bout of depression and anxiety around Thanksgiving and Christmas. But, and this might sound odd, I honestly don't know why. I didn't have any traumatic experiences around these holidays in my life, but clearly, my body and mind is reacting to something. Has anyone else had this experience where they feel way worse around an specific annual time but don't have a clear understanding as to why?

Thank you!"
57,How do I pull my head out of this?,depression,"It’s not that I like waking up every day feeling like shit, it feels inevitable. I either wake up okay or wake up feeling like trash and just want to go back to sleep.

I wish I didn’t have anything I had to do, I don’t even have the energy to do it, I just want to sleep forever."
58,I'm not even sure how I feel.,depression,Am I getting better? Worse? Is it even depression anymore? Was it ever depression? What the f*ck am I feeling? Do I even feel anything anymore? Why am I asking myself all this crap??
59,WoW.Shadowlands has finally made me hit rock bottom ( not in the way you think ),depression,"I have actually been planning to make a thread similar to this for a year...which - as you will see if you read on - coincides very well with the rest of my personality...

I am a 29 yo male, best described as a major fuckup by profession. I studied at an ""elite"" highschool in my country, had OK grades, but never really studied much after my mom let go of micromanaging my studies, thinking if I did so well up till now I would be fine on my own..

Well she was right...sort of. I did decently on my country's equivalent of SATs, and got accepted to a great university. At this point I had to start making my decisions even more, and college work was \*impossible\* , by this point I was such an awful procrastinator that I was doomed to fail. 

And so I did, dropped right out. I still remember my mom crying at the dinner table, telling me to just go become a factory worker if I completely neglect studies.

Then I reapplied to a ""weaker"" uni, thinking the problem could be solved with an easier curriculum, spoiler alert..it wasn't . At this point I was living doing the odd online jobs, something to scrape together enough money to rent a room, and to continue existing. 

I never left the house on my own accord between the ages 14-25. I had crippling social anxiety, I had issues with my looks, issues with my very self. I dropped out of 4 (yes, four) universities in total, and I wasn't even close to making it at any point. I don't think I did more than 10 hours of effective studying put together during all those years. 

Spent years basically wasting time, with anything, really games, videos, reddit, youtube. At first I thought it must be some kind of video game addiction, or whatever, but no It was not. Even back in high school, I literally sat in an empty room with only my books, and still managed to put together close to zero effective work. 

I went to study in the library during my university days, and I managed sit with my books, and decided instead to read up on nanotubes in a random book next to me ( literally). It was all so agitating, because all the while it was eating me up inside, even during those very moments.

I went back to live with my parents in the countryside after my streak of failures. My mom pushed me into a desk job, which was the most basic data entry position ever, with my lack of skill or knowledge in anything. I don't fault her, I am thankful because I am incapable of making such an effort on my own ( think I am pretty much the perfect homeless person candidate in a different universe ). 

I do odd things. Once my boss asked me to complete a task that would take at best 2 hours of active work. I finished that shit by 4 am, yes 4 am.  Stayed up all night because I can't spend more than 2 minutes focusing on work at once.

I tried learning to code, (what I went to uni for at first), but I've started the udemy classes I bought about 30 times by now, never got further than 10 minutes in, like ever.

Sometimes I literally take 5 minutes of walking up and down to start taking a shower. I actually started working out at home as well. Only issue is, it takes me roughly 3 horus to complete a 45 min routine, because I take massive breaks before and after every set....I just can't...Oh yea, and I do it at night before going to sleep, I just can't get myself to do it during the day.

So anyway...COVID came. My company let go of the weaker performers of some divisions. Needless to say, I was one of them.  My boss' words ""we know this could have been very different, but you never shown any willingness for it""

So yea, I was earning minimum wage. Which in my country Estonia is 520 euros a month. Or basically 8500$ a year for you americans. I had that for 3 years..and I never managed to move a finger to change it.

I hated work, i hated going to work, I hated my wage, everything about it. But I was powerless to make the tiniest change. 

I am sick...I know I am. There is no way a human is supposed to exist the way I do.

I've seen psychiatrists in the past, 2 times to be exact. I was diagnosed with depression both times, put on SSRI meds. 

The meds worked, somewhat, but not in the way I wished they did. My doc told me I will find joy in more things once again once we continue with the therapy, but it did fuckall for me.

My mood was improved by a lot, I wasn't a miserable person anymore, but I was still ME. Still unable to do anything productive, unable to control any of my urges. Still the weird person doing 3 hour workouts during the night. Out of a job for 4 months now, back at home living with my parents, living on my last savings.

And how does WoW come into all this you might ask? It's just something I have done for every expansion that ever released since my high school years. Come together with my friends and have a good time. 

I am too ashamed to tell them I am out of the shitty job I even had. They are all on actual career paths, with their degrees. 

Once it registered in me that I can't even afford to buy a 50 euro game to play with them, and that I am inevitably going to lie about it to them... it just felt like a nice roundoff to all my past failures.

Cried for a solid hour, then I made the decision to tell about it to some randoms on the internet. Maybe someone will read it, not that there is much of interest in here. And yea, that decision was 2 days ago and you are only just reading it now. 

Thank you,

And sorry to all of those who put faith in me ever being a useful human being in any measureable way. Sorry for disappointing you, though I hope none of you ever read this."
60,Those seasonal blues,depression,"I work hard year round to make sure I’m taking supplements, medications, eating healthy and exercising but what happens around mid November? I feel down. I lost my mom ten years ago around this time so in some ways it could be linked but I’m just frustrated because I feel like no matter how good of a headspace I’m in during the summer months, I seem to go right back to feeling sad again and lacking motivation to do anything. Anyone have suggestions other than getting a light box? :)"
61,I’m already dead,depression,"That’s how it feels. Nothing makes me feel and I’m too scared to kill myself so I just try to escape reality..it’s all nothing, a lie, a distraction, worthless waste of time and I’m tired of pretending I give a shit. I’m only here bc I’m afraid to die and the nothingness that follows"
62,The last stage of grief- acceptance is a fucking paradox in relationships.,depression,"I have no friends. I decided to be me too much, especially in a world that favors the hivemind and bandwagoner mentality, individuality is dead.

I go through the first 4 stages and am now in an endless loop of stage 3 and 4

why?

I am forced to accept not having a SIMPLE FUNDAMENTALLY HUMAN CONCEPT.

I AM FORCED. TO ACCEPT SOMETHING RUBBED IN MY FUCKING FACE EVERY FUCKING DAY.

""uwuuu don't look at social media it damages you""

NO SHIT IT DOES. BUT WHAT ABOUT OUTSIDE? WHAT ABOUT. EVERY FACET OF THE FUCKING WORLD?

The best advice would be to not exist at all."
63,I'm tired of being mean,depression,"Turns out that my depression and self-loathing cause me to lash out at other people. Even complete strangers aren't immune to my bullshit. I don't want to use my mental illness as an excuse for horrible behavior, but it literally only happens when I start feeling my self-worth plummet. I think I'm going to have to start cutting other people out of my life just to spare them from me.

Anyone one else here have this problem?"
64,my friends are my only source of happiness &amp; the thing that stresses me out most,depression,"i’ve been really depressed, the last few months especially. i noticed today that 99% of the time i’m only okay when i’m with my friends &amp; they are having a good time. like i’m never depressed when they give me attention. but when i’m alone, i get so sad. i’m so dependent on them. i don’t cling that much because i know it’ll drive them away (it’s my 2 best friends). 

they also stress me the hell out &amp; make me sad. when they act distant or mad or uninterested i get so much anxiety &amp; cry &amp; it eats me alive. they live rent free in my head constantly. i’m more consumed with their lives than i am with mine. 

does anyone else have this problem? 

how do i make my own happiness? &amp; how can i start thinking about myself instead of others?"
65,I wish something bad would happen to me,depression,"I want something horrible to happen to me. So my parents would not feel guilty if I died. I think of crashing my car and hoping the evidence points to me being asleep at the wheel or something. I don't want to live. The only reason I do is so my parents and my 5 other siblings are happy. 

But I am so suicidal all the time, I don't know how much I can take. I have already attempted, I just don't know how long I can fight. Its daily at this point, and is just easier to give in. I am tempted to try anti-depressants but I don't want to get stuck on them for life."
66,No clue what to do anymore to make myself happier,depression,"I showered, got dressed, ordered a fat takeaway, ate it, had caffeine, vaped, masturbated, gone on a walk, talked to friends, drank water and am watching my favourite movie just crying a bit because I don't feel any better. I feel like nothing will fill that void in my head. I feel like I have a craving to do something that would make me happy but no clue what that is. Drop any ideas what I could do to feel some sort of way below, I'm lost for ideas now."
67,Opening up about your feelings can be such a paradox.,depression,"At the point that I'm at, my two choices are either to open up about my feelings, tell someone about how bad I feel constantly, or to shove it all down like I usually do. 

In option 1, I open up to someone, tell them I want to die, and what happens? They cry, they blame themselves, they walk on eggshells around you for months, and you have to work extremely hard to put up a façade of happiness so that they can be ok. Nothing good can come of it, at least in my position, because I don't have anybody that truly cares or that can put my emotional stability before theirs for even an instant. It's not their fault, I can't expect anybody to care about me when I can't care about myself, can I? at this point I'm not very capable of loving people anymore, and so the reward to anybody who tries to help of strengthening a relationship is not available.

In option 2, I repress the bad feelings with escapist media and drugs like I usually do, but that is obviously even worse for me. In the short term, however, I am able to function somewhat normally, and I can spare people around me from the potentially immense burden of giving a shit about my emotional stability. Long term, however, this strategy probably leads to a suicide attempt, which if discovered could hurt the people around me even worse than if I opened up to them in the first place. 

It really is a shitty situation to be in. either way, at some point I am going to selfishly inflict pain on people around me, and tbh I'm not worth the effort most of the time. like so many aspects of depression, I am trapped on a road with daunting prospects at every possible turn.

(yes i'm aware of how irrational this all is, but this is just my feelings manifesting in a circular argument i'm having with myself constantly)"
68,I can’t handle everything life has thrown at me and I need help.,depression,"I can’t do this. I’m failing all my classes, and I haven’t even payed tuition yet. I have no energy for anything, not even things I used to love. I have no goals. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I just can’t bring myself to care about anything. The only thing that kept me going through high school was my friends and without that support my life as completely crumbled. I don’t want to let down my parents or be a burden on them forever, god knows how much they’ve done for me already. I’ve never felt such horrible dread in my entire life. Everywhere I look my life is collapsing in and suffocating me. I don’t know what to do. I know I need help but it’s such a terrifying thing to ask for. I’m afraid I won’t be taken seriously, I know my mom has 0 understanding of mental illness. I just can’t find a way forward. I need help."
69,Am I overreacting? Should I not care?,depression,"(21m) I have a childhood friend group that was disbanded with. I had a history of doing dumb shit in the past, so I was never really invited to gatherings I was still in group chats with them. They removed me January and I was sunken in depression.

A year before they removed me, my ex broke up with me because I was toxic (this is true) I've had lots of fuckups in my life but thankfully I'm back on track as of now and learned plenty of lessons and wasn't the person in my past.

Now my ex-friendgroup are chilling with my ex and I'm looking at this in social media and just.. astonished. Full of emotions, I may still miss her and I may still miss them... I don't know if I'm even more depressed or just feel belittled by society

I've broken no contact with my ex many times but thankfully on a good half year streak and no I have probably only residual feeling left, my friends feelings are out the window because I was always treated like dirt 

I guess I'm just fearing they are both just slandering me as jokes and just saying the dumb stuff I've done with both of them"
70,Shit family no friends hating life,depression,So fucking bullshit how some people have these things in life. I want friends but seem to hate everyone and get angry/bitter. I'm so tired and just want to be alone. Parents keep fighting and life is so shit. Moving out sounds like so much effort when i can barely just do school and i feel so exhausted and unmotivated. i want to cry forever or just leave this world. im so exhausted and tired. let me sleep forever.
71,Suicidal thoughts are starting to kick in,depression,"Please, someone reach out to me. The thought of calling my local helpline fills me with so much anxiety. I can’t text 741741 either, because I don’t live in the US.

I thought I was slowly making progress (especially with my body dysmorphia), but I just had a sudden panic attack while scrolling through Reddit, and realised exactly how numb I am to the thought of death. I’m scared. I don’t want to die. I’m only 18, I should have so much to live for. I’m not alone, but it feels like I am. I need someone to talk to."
72,Fire Starter,depression,"You try hard to start a fire. It takes a long time and a lot of effort. Rubbing sticks together until you get an ember. Slowly nurturing it and building it into a big enough flame that can keep you warm. You keep feeding it trying to keep it going as long as possible. But the fire goes out. ""No bother"" most say. They quickly get to rebuilding the fire. Pretty soon they've got their fire going again.

Depression is rain.

It's raining over you and your sad little bundle of wet fire wood. You can rub em together all you like, no fire will come of it.

Your best hope is to build some kind of shelter, to protect that fire from the rain. But now you're stuck with twice the work, half the time, four times the effort and all just for a little bit of warmth.

And if you do manage to get that fire made with something to shelter it from the rain, by the time you feel its warmth, everyone else has already used theirs to cook their meals. And you remember ""oh right, I gotta eat too.""

That's love. That food you want in your belly. Your warm now, just about. But you're starving.

And I ask myself, is this really worth it?"
73,Is this life?,depression,"I finally got a job. It's nothing special, I'm just a part time cashier, but it's money right? If I do well, I may be moved to full time.

And... I should be happy. I'm an adult, I'm contributing to society, I'm not a burden on my parents.

Yet I just feel utter contempt. I can't believe that, day in and day out, this is going to be my life. That's all there is to is, working and struggling and working and struggling and... until I finally die and this torture ends.

I feel bad because I know a lot of people lost their income due to the pandemic but at the same time I can't be happy because I just don't want to be alive. I just want to sleep, close my eyes and disappear.

I'm just tired, y'know? I don't even know of what but I am. And yet, tomorrow I'll wake up, get dressed, go to work, do my job with a smile, then return home, and rinse and repeat.

Just what's the point?"
74,I think I’m having a major breakdown and I don’t know how to cope,depression,"Last night I had the worst panic attack I had ever had in my life, I couldn’t walk and I had to get my housemate to help me down the stairs (I was in the  bathroom on the floor, I live in the basement). I’m struggling to cope, the people I would trust in this situation have either shown me they want nothing to do with it or have their own shit going on and because of COVID my old coping mechanisms (mainly spending all my free time working on theatre shows) is gone. 

I feel like I performing enough functionality to keep the people around me from figuring out how bad it’s gotten. I struggle to eat, I’ve started relying on weed to get me through the day and nothing I do has any meaning anymore. 

The only reason I haven’t tried to unalive myself at this point is because I refuse to be the cause of my best friends next breakdown.

I either struggle to feel any emotion or a feel an emotion so strongly it occupies me for days."
75,I can’t do basic mental math and I’m 23.,depression,"I can’t:

What’s yours?"
76,I hate myself,depression,"However bad of a human being you think you are, I am a hundred times worse than that.

\- I don't have any friends

\- My relationship with my family is strained

\- I don't have any connections

\- I don't have any talents or skills. Like, none at all. A lot of times I see users on this sub that still are GOOD at things, but I foolishly wasted away my entire life and now I'm good at absolutely nothing. I have nothing to give to the world.

\- I am a genuinely selfish and toxic person. I wish I could say it was because of some trauma in my past so at least I have justification, but the root cause is that I just am a terrible person. 

I wish I could die."
77,Heck,depression,"Just like fuck me man, I’m just an average schlump. Spent two years writing a book, released it to maybe 100 sales in a year, which is more than I expected. I’m going to school but all I can focus on is finishing it and getting the fuck out of this town. I’m in a relationship that I’m not sure I want to be in. I’m in a boring Midwest municipality. I’m stuck, desperately trying to escape the quick sand of my surroundings bu the more I struggle the more stuck I seem to become. There nothing, however, that is redeeming about me. No extraordinary circumstances will lift me out of my station and I just can’t force myself to accept that."
78,overdose.,depression,"the internet says anything more than 10,000mg of tylenol will kill me. i just took 15,000mg. i will respond to any comments in the morning if i survive. if not... goodbye. i hope you all find inner peace someday."
79,Anhedonia,depression,"Anhedonia, 

A desolate nausea

Shame as destiny

Seed of this inner rot

Vomits forth a paralyzing venom

This Beast born of a fallen nature

Risen from a Psychical Sea

Champion of His Father: 

Withering Time

Cannibal of Hopes and Dreams

What is Lost, 

Repentance cannot Resurrect"
80,2020 has fucked me over so much. I think I’m done.,depression,"I came back from the US to Singapore on December 2019 depressed. I wasn’t eating, wasn’t sleeping and crying everyday. I had an internship and performed so badly when I usually have a good track record. My boyfriend came over from the US in February and things got better. Staying at home made me have toxic thoughts because of a toxic environment. COVID then hit us hard in March and by April everything was closed. We had the biggest recession ever and unemployment rates rose. My boyfriend struggled to find a job because he’s a foreigner and coupled with lockdown, we both fell into mild depression again. 

I decided to graduate early and somehow landed a good starting job with a good salary in September. Things started to pick back up for us and I decided to move in with my boyfriend to share the cost of rent. He eventually landed a private equity role and was doing well in it. For about 2 months, things seemed to be okay. 

Then he lost the job again. The company lied about their expectations and although they were much nicer, they eventually couldn’t hire him, even though they said he could. I had to move back home because of family expectations and felt myself crumbling again. I went over to my boyfriend’s last Friday and we spent the night crying because we realised that he might have to go home. He doesn’t want to go back to the US. He has nobody there and it’s still unsafe. At least here, we have no COVID cases, and he has me. 

I just want someone to give him a chance. Just one. I just want something positive to come our way. I just want people to stop lying to him and exploiting him. Ever since he came over we’ve met countless hurdles that no relationship should ever go through. How is this fair? I feel myself losing interest in eating and recreational activities again. I have no energy. I cry everyday and just lie in bed. We are not bad people. Why us? Why not give us a break, so that we can be stable for once? 

I don’t want to be depressed again but I know I am. I’ve been spamming Xanax everytime I get anxious just to sedate myself and so that I feel nothing. I’m losing my drive at work where I was doing so well. I’m so sick of hoping and having nothing happen. I just want the chance to love simply and easily. This has been so hard. And my suicidal thoughts are back."
81,A vision from a depressed person...,depression," 

I've realised too late in my youth what the world really is. It took me a long time to figure that out. And it took a lot of guts. I havent been happy for a very long time. But i now know that its not about being happy, but about being content. You''ll never reach happiness, so why bother? But you can be content with the way things are. And i believe thats the most important thing in life tbh.

This world isnt good. Its a bad place. If we view the world as a bad place, then every miserable thing that will happen to us will make us sad. Cause we are trying to be happy in world where its impossible. So youll try and be happy, but you wont be able to. And itll destroy your life.

But i have found a way to beat this. If you see the world as a bad place, full of suffering and torment, then youll always aim to be not sad, but just ok. Then youll always expect bad things to happen to you. But when a good thing happens to you. you'll be happy in that brief moment in time, and youll appreciate that happiness more without even striving towards it. Then youll go back to being content. And thats ok. Youll remember memories better than the average person, and those little moments where you feel happy.

so basically life isnt fair. it never was. and if we try to make it fair, we will lose everytime. so dont.

live for those little moments.

like a black dark room, and every now and then, you will see a cone of light shining from above.

see life like this, and youll be better"
82,Feeling way less Intelligent &amp; Creative,depression,"I'm 16, and I've had Depression for about 2 yrs now. It's been an absolute shithole everyday, but by now I'm pretty much used to it. Only thing is, is that for a couple of months now. I started to feel much less creative, and Intelligent. Like I said I'm used to it by now. Feeling extremely depressed, getting stressed out very easily, and doubting myself all the time. But when I started feeling less intelligent, I felt like I took a bullet to the chest. As I love solving mental puzzles, and theorizing ideas about the universe(Logical Reasoning, Lateral Thinking, Abstract Reasoning, thought experiments, etc). And I wanted to become Theoretical Physicist, or an Astronomer. Those were my hobbies, along with gaming...I don't really have many friends as you can probably tell lol. Oddly enough, I didn't pick up the puzzles hobby until I just started feeling depressed a couple years back. I didn't share my hobbies with anyone though, as I didn't want to. Because I felt so different from everyone else, that no one understood me, so it was extremely hard for me to relate to them. But that's why I have different personalities for each friend lol. It always gave me satisfaction when doing things like these, and that was enough to keep me going. But now I'm feeling Way less motivated to solve anything because when I do I feel like a Absolute Idiot, gaming barely entertains me anymore, and I'm starting to get really scared now. Because Intelligence &amp; Creativity, were my skills. If I didn't have them. then who would I be. They weren't always though, as in middle school &amp; kindergarten my parents were told I had some sort of learning disability, and apparently something called ""Fine Motor Delay"" in my hands. So in middle school, anything, or any classes my teachers didn't think I could handle/do, I taken out of. I didn't know this back then though. I have more control over my classes in High School though, luckily. So School was hell for me then, and it is NOW. I still don't understand a single thing they're trying to teach me, which makes me worry for my career, since my grades are JUST above average. Sorry for the rant, I'm just Really scared that I'm losing myself, and everything along with it. Everynight I feel like I just want to run away from home, and isolate myself. I have also have suicidal thoughts. But I've been seeing a Psychologist for just a little bit(which seems to be going really well actually :). I am new to this reddit page btw. But does anyone else feel like they're losing/lost their intelligence/creativity, or sense of self???"
83,I have no idea what this is i jut know i probably need help,depression,Im just in the middle of a depressive episode and it feels like it not going end which im honestly used to but these have been happening way more and at this im not sure if i want to die or if i want alcohol and drugs (kind of an addict at this point but im broke). The only reason i haven't tried killing myself again is because im afraid of what happens after. But even with that i probably should just do away with it and kill myself im such a terrible person it would be great so people won't have to deal with my bullshit. I haven't talked to my friends about this because depression has pretty much became my personality at this point and i don't want to make them sad everytime i talk to them. They have their own shit they don't need to deal with mine. Can't talk to my family because just believe that i want attention all the time or they put words in my mouth and make it different from what it is. Idk i'm being an idiot
84,Poetry,depression,"What’s real life like. I feel like an observer.

Viewing through a lens of extreme depression, pain, and loathing of all and self.

I sit in my room kept alive by food and the molecular processes of my body. I see the world through youtube, netflix, online interaction. All contrived performances. Then if I want to go to the real thing I get so much anxiety I can’t be myself. Can’t think.

If I was to really be myself I would constantly scream fuck you and punch everyone. Flipping them off but they wouldn’t care so I would have to hurt them physically."
85,Why is school so hard?,depression,"Im a senior in highschool. I just recently got out of a relationship and it was very very mentally deteriorating. It fucked me up, bad. And then one of my closest friends got together with that girl. I seperated myself from them and my entire old friends and now i have nobody to talk to, alone and stressed. I missed about 3 weeks in total so far just from depression and anxiety alone so my grades have plummeted. I have a scholarship waiting for me so i have to work on my grades so thats hard. I dont know what to do anymore, im just sad and depressed and i cant stand school :("
86,I really struggle with the fact that people like me,depression,"Title says it all really. People like me, I have lots of friends, I’m always welcome in social events. Even when my friends found out I’ve been struggling with depression they didn’t reject me, they’ve been doing everything they can to try and support me. Last night (after drinking a lot it has to be said) a friend of mine went on a spiel about how great he thinks I am. I figured it was just the drink talking, but he reassured me today that he meant every word. And for some reason the fact that they like me, even love me, is so hard to deal with. 

At first I wasn’t sure why but after a while I figured it out. I don’t love myself, I don’t even like myself. On paper I have a lot going for me, but I still feel like a colossal failure almost all the time. My prospects should be great, but I can’t take advantage of them because most of the time I feel too depressed to do anything, which in turn makes me feel worse because I feel useless and lazy for not doing anything. 

Which brings me to people liking me. How can people like me when I don’t like myself? The fact that they are seeing something in me that I just can’t see myself makes me feel like a massive fraud, like I’m cheating them by presenting a great image of myself that simply doesn’t exist. And so hearing nice things said about me, in a really weird way, only reinforces my own negative view of myself. 

I know in my heart of hearts that this is crazy. I know I shouldn’t feel this way. But I do, and I don’t know how to break this cycle of negative thoughts. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks for reading either way."
87,I don’t look like myself anymore,depression,"i hate how i look now, i used to be the girl that everyone adores. but now, i can’t even look at myself without feeling disgust. depression kills me slowly. i’m literally skin and bone. i used to cut my hair as a way to cope. recently i shaved it all bcs it has reached the state that can’t be fixed anymore. my arm is full of scars. i hate everything about me. i want to go to sleep and never wake up again...."
88,How do you not internalize how people treat you as a reflection on yourself?,depression,If people treat me poorly how can I not hate myself for it? I feel like I must be scum because if I wasn't worthless people would be nicer to me.
89,I don’t know what’s going on anymore,depression,"To preface, I have been struggling for years now, harking back to my childhood. I basically failed my A-levels and wanted to take some time off for myself, but no, I was given the ultimatum to either apply for university or find work. I got stuck into hard drugs (specifically GHB and amphetamine) 3 years ago and that really took a toll on my serotonin and dopamine, and I have been far worse off since stopping that and going to rehab last year. I was prescribed quetiapine and that’s done nothing but made me gain weight, completely numb me emotionally, made me lose ALL motivation for my hobbies, and basically made me not want to get out of bed.

This year has been really tough. Like *really* tough. I was off work most of this year and I lost my job at the end of July. So far I have had no luck in finding new employment. I had to stop looking two months ago because I just couldn’t do it. Everyone asks me if I’m doing okay and I just give the standard ‘yes’, because I don’t know what else to say.

I’ve been on and off drinking all year. Like 1-2 week binges with a 70cL bottle of vodka a day. It’s one of the only things that makes me feel okay. I have no friends whatsoever, and when I try to talk to people, they end up blanking me or flat out leaving. I’ve given up with that now. I don’t have anyone, and I don’t want to talk to people.

To top it all off, I got into contact with my GP about a medication change to sertraline to see if that can help. I’ve tried therapy/counselling and mental health courses. They do not work. I last heard from my GP and local mental health service about their considerations of changing my medication. That was on the 3rd of November. I’ve so far got into contact with my GP twice since then, and have heard absolutely nothing.

All I want is to feel okay, find another job, and be productive again. My room is a tip, my bed is covered in random things and rubbish. I can’t be bothered. I don’t care anymore.

I guess I’m just having a bad day today. I don’t want pity. I don’t want attention. I don’t want people to tell me that everything is going to be alright. I just want to let you all know that life is fucking shit and I honestly don’t see the point in going on. No, I’m not suicidal. No, I haven’t self harmed recently. I just want to get back into taking drugs because at least is something to make life feel worth it again. Not like I even know any dealers though, so that’s a dead avenue.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
90,I fucked up. I got super drunk and upset for an unknown reason and went off on my SO saying every hurtful thing in the book.,depression," I know I didn’t mean any of it, it was just my deep emotions and hatred toward myself coming out. I know I need help, the SO says I need help. He is no longer my SO because of it. Depression messes things up again. Sorry for the rambling I’m just hurt"
91,What have you figured out about yourself that helped?,depression,"If you've beein going to therapy or you've been on antidepressant or doing something that helped you out throughout the journey of depression - or not and you have accepted it all as is. Maybe you've made it to the other side and are now happy. Maybe your professional said one thing that stuck with you.

What realization have you had for yourself that makes it easier to get up?

Because I'm not so sure"
92,It's just so bad tonight,depression,I just feel so broken and worthless and helpless and I'm so tired of living. I'm tired of faking that I'm happy. Crying alone in my dark room trying to pull it together and go back out to the living room and get my daughter ready for bed. My heart just hurts so bad and I'm tired of doing this alone.
93,in case of an emergency letter,depression,"What if you would write a text and hand it to a person which is with you when you feel down or sad.

The text would include multible ways in that the person could help me and a rough description how they should react. Also a line where I tell them that they don't have to worry.

For some reason I think this is a great idea but many of my great idead turned out very bad in the past...

So if you could tell me if you like the idea that would be very helpful :)"
94,What I think about God (Please read ),depression,"1. God may be your creator but God is not your friend. If God was really your friend, you could complain to God &amp; you could angrily express yourself to God but you can't. If you do that to a real friend, he/she will cry with you but if you do that God, God won't tolerate it.  So God can be anything but your friend. 

2. God don't help the helpless, God only gives more to the ones who already have it. Did you know that approximately 3.1 million kids die from undernutrition each year? And some people make 100K$ per month and their income keep increasing. 

3. Religious people care more about their belief than they care about your well being and God loves it. 

Nobody gives a fuck about me so my beliefs don't matter. And As I've said all these things about God, he is pissed rn probably and he will send me to hell without any question. 

But before I go to hell, I would like to have a chat with God for like 10 minutes. 
I'd say, ""Okay, all my life you've given me suffering and now you're sending me to hell. What's your profit in it?"" 

God:- You've committed sin and you deserve punishment for that. 

Me:- What sin? I expressed my honest thought about you...that was a sin? 

God:- Yup. 

Me:- Okay, cool. But did I lie? Can you please answer those questions? 

God:- I'm not obligated to answer your questions cuz I'm God. 

Me:- So you're just a ruler who does whatever he wants? 

God:- You idiot. You foolish young boy. You understand nothing. I'll double your punishment.

Me:- Wait a minute....did you just take that personally? You're **God**. You've everything how can you take that personally? Lol 

God:- Hey, Angels of Hell. Grab him and throw him to hell. 

Me:- God, we aren't finished. 

God:- But you're finished. 

Me:- That's not fair. 

God:- I decide what's fair and what's unfair.

Me:- So you're like the Dictator Aladin who receives gold medal in his own Olympic? 

God:- Angels of Hell, Throw him out already. 

Me:- Okay okay, one last question. 

God:- Quick 

Me:- My mom is going to heaven. She will feel sad when she'll know that I'm in hell, right? 

God:- *Hysterical Laugh* 

Me:- 👀

God:- I'm gonna make your mom forget you. I'm God I can do anything. 

Me:- What the.........



..............
Angels of hell grabbing me....          

Me:- Why are you doing these?
 
AOH:- Cuz God told me to do so.
 
Me:- So you guys are like dumb machines?

AOH:- God is great. God is great....

95,"I have little motivation to help myself, but I know that I need it desperately.",depression,"I’ve been off my meds for about a month now. I ran out of my antidepressants and was feeling good so I thought fuck it, I don’t need them. (Which was very dumb of me to think.) Since then I’ve been spiraling. I’m failing school (college student), quit both of my jobs because they became too overwhelming and I wanted to die thinking about them, I’m falling behind on bills. I can’t stop thinking about bad things. My little brother dying on Christmas last year. My grandpa who raised me is deteriorating from ALS. I have no friends and no social life. My car won’t work and I can’t afford to fix it. The list goes on. 

Anyways, long story short, things aren’t going well. I know that I need to get better. I can’t kill myself because it’ll hurt my family. What steps can I take to resolve all of this shit that I’ve done to myself? Baby steps... please"
96,I feel like I'm claustrophobic,depression,"I feel like ive entered into a bunker, and the door is locked behind me, and ahead is nothing but a dark hallway with a wall at the end, and im alone and scared inside an empty hallway with no way out. And even if i did get out, there would be nothing but destruction, an empty wasteland. I am so lonely and tired, and scared. I have nothing to look forward to, and ive done nothing with my life to this point and its too late to make something of myself. I just want to stop existing, just die, and be done with all of this fear, and pointless struggle."
97,I’m eating to fill the void.,depression,But the void is bigger than my stomach and that bitch is expanding. I don’t care that I probably have gum disease and I have cardiac issues... im still shovelling ice cream and chips down my mouth because I can’t find anything else to fill the 1440 minutes each day. What do you do to fill the time? How do you push through each day?
98,Idk,depression,"I feel like everything I  my life is slipping. My relationships are so few now and even fewer that I actually see/ interact with on a normal basis. I have no drive or motivation at all. I lie to people about how I'm doing constantly. I lie to people about ""progress"" I'm making in life constantly. I feel I've dug myself so deep I cant climb back out and I dont even try. I ignore my problems even though they arent going to go away. I'm tired all the time, I can distract myself for a while with shit I dont even really enjoy anymore but no matter what I'm just tired. I wish someone could just know the whole situation and help me but I'm terrified of the thought of asking for it, because I do t think I'm worth the effort to help. Not sure why I'm even posting this, but if anyone actually reads this if you have any motivation I can borrow I need it."
99,what do I do,depression,I turned 18 about a month ago been diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 15 and i was definitely feeling down a lot but recently the past week my mood has been switching from happy wanting to to everything to so terrible my mind goes blank and i just sit there not moving and it just feels aweful going back and forth like every few hours i dont know what to do anymore
100,"I want to enjoy life and find purpose but I have no skills, friends, or dreams. My life feels like a huge failure that’s all my fault.",depression,"I just don’t know what to do with my life. I have wasted most of my life playing video games and as I reach the end of high school, life feels even more hopeless. I want to be good at something, I want to have something to look forward to but I don’t know what I want to do. I have literally zero friends. I spent the last few months chasing a dream I knew from the beginning was impossible yet I told myself it could happen and despite knowing deep down it was impossible to achieve, when I got to this point where I see it is definitely impossible, I still feel stupid for thinking I could achieve it. My life feels so directionless and I have no idea where I will end up mainly because I don’t have an end goal. All my dreams have been crushed because the dreams I chased were either doomed from the beginning because they were too crazy, or something about my life changed in a way that I couldn’t achieve them. I just wish I were good at something or had some friends, real friends. I don’t want my life to be pointless, but that’s all I feel it is."
101,Depressed and need someone to talk to,depression,I’m so depressed and lonely and would like someone to talk to. I also really need help with something and would appreciate some help. Anything I’d be so so thankful for.
102,nothing to live for,depression,"I've been struggling with depression since years, and getting worse over time. I have been to different psychologists throughout my life, but none have helped me, and I don't feel like trying again. it's enough, I've really had too much.
I don't think it's normal to experience so many horrible things in such a short period of life. family violence, drunk and addicted to drugs mom, complicated surgeries, rapes, low social life, low self-esteem and many more things that I could go on to name. I feel like my life is a real hell, every day it feels worse. my personality is really upbeat and positive, but depression is consuming me. even the days when I try my best, I end up crying out of nowhere, and even having a crisis. I currently only have three people helping me, and I don't feel like they love me too much. I am not self-harming myself as much as I used to, because I am afraid that my family will see my injuries. But before I used to do it several times a day, almost every day.
a week ago I had a suicide attempt, another of many, I keep wondering why I didn't do it, I really can't find an answer. nothing. really nothing else to live for. I really wish to be free from all this suffering forever.

any messages of support would be appreciated, I'm truly hopeless about continuing to live. by the way, sorry for my bad English."
103,Tired,depression,"My depression literally feels like a weight dragging me down; dragging my soul down. I wake up every morning and the weight of my reality feels like a sumo wrestler sitting on my chest. 
I try and go to the gym to make it better but it frustrates me that it’s gonna take years for me to lose all this weight just to potentially feel better and attract a women. 
My love life is nonexistent and I go on tinder everyday just to come to the realization that no woman within a 30 mile radius of me finds me attractive. 
If I do get a match, the women seem to never want to actually meet me in person. Especially with covid. It sucks because I know if I looked better, they wouldn’t care about covid or make excuses. 
I’m starting a new job and today’s my first day and I’m struggling to find the strength to get up and go. The work’s gonna be shit and so will the pay. But I need it because I’m broke as shit. 
I have goals but I’ve just been feeling so burnt out lately and don’t feel like I have the strength to go on much longer and pursue them. Given that everything in my life up to this point has been a complete failure. I’m really starting to adopt a ‘why even bother mentality’ because of it. My life is just such a shit show and I just can’t see things getting better even if I try."
104,"Hello, everyone. I have/ still am struggling with depression. But when feeling really low i find it helpful to write a poem about how i feel. This is one i wrote last week.",depression,"Death 
Its all i can hear 
Its all i can see
Its all i can feel 
The only thing that is real 
The only thing accomplishable 
The only thing i can ever achive 

Have you ever felt so alone?
Have you ever been lonely?
Even if you are not
Even if you have supportive friends 
You can feel so alone 
So destructive 
So harmful 

You think if im not going to hurt others. 
It will be myself 
It will always be myself 

Have you ever felt that you could disappear? 
Without anyone noticing 
Anyone hearing 
Anyone caring 

Death 
It always resorts to death 
The thing that can ruin you 
Just by saving you 
The thing that is pain 
The thing that stops pain 

It makes you wonder 
It makes you ponder 
On whether the pain is really worth it 

But then you remember 

The people?
Your friends that will do anything 
That your death would ruin 
Your parents who think its a excuse 
That your death would ruin 

And then there are the people who
Would blame themselves 
Who would hold themselves accountable 
Those are the people who need to be held tight

To a mother, losing children is death 
And for someone else, losing stability is death"
105,[M18] I want to commit suicide really badly...,depression,"But if I do that, it would ruin my mother's life. What can I do?"
106,I’ll never live up to who I want to become,depression,"  People in my family tell me constantly how proud they are of me for where I’m at so early in life. I don’t see where they’re coming from, I see my colleagues from high school all in college, some have gone to make something of themselves, others are just living life because they have a huge financial background due to their parents. I hate the fact that I was born into such a fucked up family, so poor, so unfortunate at every turn. I’ll never be satisfied with myself until I’m making a comfortable living. But in order to do that, I have to go to college in which I cannot afford after rent, insurance, car payments, phone bill, etc etc. I actually have a deep disgust and hatred for who I am as a person. Everyone says I need to uplift myself more but no matter how hard I’ll work. I know I’ll never become someone or at least something I can be proud of. What the fuck am I even still doing here if I’m waking up everyday just to do the same exact job night after night. With no new results, getting bitched at by my co workers just for the sake of them being able to complain. I’m such a failure and disgrace to myself. 

TL;DR: I hate that I can’t find a job without college that pays well, but I can’t afford college. Have a strong &amp; severe case of self depreciation because I see old friends doing better than me!"
107,Rage.,depression,"Rage. That’s all I feel anymore. Pure unadulterated rage. At everyone and everything. I lash out at people, I’m unjustly mean to them. You know what though? It. Feels. Good! I said it. It feels amazing, it’s my drug. I know it’s not good, but I can’t stop. Lashing out is...addicting. It’s nice to finally be the loudest in the room, to be HEARD! To finally let out all the years of hate and anger and fear, even at random people.

I’m sorry














But not really"
108,"Loss of emotions, craving sensation.",depression,"I have recently quit drinking after a 2 1/2 year run of heavy drinking, culminating in about a 3 month bender. I went to detox and rehab and have been out in the world for a few weeks. I have had major depressive episodes in the past and my drinking was mainly a result of crippling general anxiety, both of which are now helped by medication and positive coping techniques.

I am now not currently feeling anything. I'm not happy, I'm not sad, I'm not even blah. There is just nothing. I've experienced emotional blunting before, but this is on a completely different level.  I had a a panic attack last week that bore no physical symptoms and I felt robbed of sensation and feeling. So much so that the thought of self-harm has stuck in my head.

I keep hearing that this is 'normal', but what I've dealt with and experienced in the past, this is a completely different thing. It's like there is no self. 

I guess I'm just looking for feedback on anyone that has felt this way or have a better place for info or advice."
109,There are so many chances to spiral.,depression,"Somehow almost everything feels traumatic in my mind, and it’s **such** a battle trying not to be sucked into the downward spiraling abyss.

It’s so tiring. I’m tired. I want my mind to take a break from the world. Wish sleep actually doesn’t make me feel worse.

Wish I could live peacefully with and within myself lmao.

Everything is a performance."
110,Super annoyed that I got my first official job after several years of depression and I can't do anything with my earnings.,depression,"I was really depressed because nobody would employ me (and in general), then one day out of the blue I got a yes, and while I don't particularly enjoy my job, I was just so happy to be comfortable with money again.

Just as this happens we are thrown into a shitty dystopia where nobody can do anything anymore..literally in case someone sneezes...

I wanted to take a few weekend holidays in my own country or maybe go abroad for my first solo adventure  (I missed out on a lot of stuff in my 20s and early 30s because I just had awful luck in life)

I don't want to fill my days off all the time with hobbies, I tried doing that but buying tons of materialistic crap doesn't fill the void very much.

I just want to go exploring epic scenery and stay in a hostel or something.

I've spent most of my life being too anxious to see the wider world for myself, by myself.

It's not as fun the way things are now, everyone is literally implored to avoid each other, so I can't meet new people while travelling."

112,Every day it gets easier,depression,"2 years on anti depressants

113,I don't understand what's happening (Realisation I'll never be good enough for her),depression,"I wanted her to be happy and she's genuinely happy now with another guy, she told me about the dude so nicely, without hurting much of my feelings.But I can't get over it.
It's been 12 hours and I haven't moved from my bed apart from using the toilet.She had felt a heart ache before and that's why she had built walls around her heart, she talked to me everyday tho.We talked about life and shit, I'm trying very hard to impress her each day.Then a writer comes by in her life.She sent me a ss.It was hurtful af.Things he said were so nice and deep..They are genuinely completing eachothers sentences and that's my problem.I can't get over it that I'm not good enough, he touched her heart under 1 hour or them talking while I couldn't do it for 5 months."
114,I'm gradually ruining my life with my porn addiction,depression,"Mixed with ADHD meds, I go on porn binges. I managed to prevent binges recently but there's one issue I always had,I become very lethargic and get tired after orgasms. For some reason it's not as bad when having sex


Anyway I didn't think it'd be a big deal and thought I'd have the situation under control but enough time has passed to make me scared, not only did the frequency grow but everytime I tell myself ""okay this is the last time"" then I either get an urge to look at something ""innocent"" enough and b4 I know it, I'm watching porn. It feels like I'm drained of any sense of discipline when I fail like that and it translates into every spheres of my lide

After binging or recently simply fapping to porn 2x+, I'm lethargic for the rest of the day,0 discipline, absolutely unproductive. When repeated often enough,it gets dangerous and you become even more hooked and undisciplined

I get moments where I'm back on track,full of energy but in a moment of weakness I'll convince myself it won't do any harm and there I am back in that trap

My grades have suffered but it's not catastrophic. Although what worries me is that I cannot afford to waste anymore time"
115,anxiety attacks,depression,"It feels so shitty having my legs tremble bc of overthinking bad things, I get nauseous every morning before going to work just bc of how shitty and nervous I feel about doing anything. I can’t do anything as I normally would. I start thinking negative things out of nowhere with EVERYTHING. I don’t feel hope anymore, I don’t feel anything that feels good. I cry out of nowhere. I feel so small and so unloved and by unloved I mean that I can’t feel that someone would care about me even if I know deep inside they might do. I don’t find happiness in anything. I feel alone and I feel scared of everything. I don’t know how I got to this point but it feels horrible. I constantly feel like every person that I meet automatically hates me. It feels awful and I’m fucking crying while I write this, it’s so stupid. I can’t cope with myself anymore."
116,"Hello, this is first time that I even spoke to someone about this.",depression,"Even when writing this I can't put how I feel into sentences, writing this makes me feel weak, and I have overwhelming feeling just to leave without posting this. I don't want bother anyone with my problems and how I feel. While writing this i have immense feeling in my mind ""Just stop, don't be a pussy"" and my hands even are starting to shake a little. I have repressed all my emotions for many years, I ignored sadness, joy or any other emotions (in best of my abilities), because I thought they got in the way of my goals. I have overworked to achieve my goals for weeks, months - I get home and study. I have pushed to work my self to the point I can't talk to others. I don't want go to work or get up in the mornings. Rigth now I have my dream job, that I was working for all my life but i don't feel anything, i feel I'm not good enough.  I haven't felt happiness in about 5 years. I haven't been emotionally close to anyone not even my parents. I do not outwardly show any kind of emotions like happiness or anger, but in inside I have immense regrets and anger. Nothing makes me happy."
117,falling apart,depression,"i know i’m not the only one and i know my problems are nothing to others but this year has been a real rough one for me. the biggest one being a 4 year relationship that has fallen apart besides me trying everything i possibly could. we could never get on the same page and i was caught in my feelings as she shut me out. i thought i was alright till i moved out. with everything going on i’ve had to resort to living with my parents and the spare room that they had set up for my kid. i really don’t have much as i’m not a very materialistic person so i’ve been sleeping in a room full of my kids stuff. no matter what i do i can’t get in the right headspace with this and to make matters worse every time i try to connect with her she ignores me. when i was still there and we argued i would always ask her if she cared and if she wanted me here. she’d say yes but i never really had the reassurance i wanted but i would never tell her that cause i wanted to just give it time. mentally i wasn’t ready for this like i thought. 


sorry i’m all over the place but this shit continues to just eat at me."
118,Bad at everything,depression,"When I was a kid I always just wanted to play and have fun, I never focused too seriously on anything and my parents didn’t push me to do anything as long as I was getting average-decent grades. They were happy with a life they had planned for me in an average university, average career etc. This didn’t make me motivated. Plus when I reached puberty I became extremely anxious and introverted and too scared to try new things. 
Flash forward I’m 20 now and have no talents. Finally at 18 I realised the importance of having some achievements but I didn’t have any and struggled to build any. Study habits are hard to build, other things I’m too delayed and everyone is so much better. 
For example I’m extremely passionate about sports now, but it’s too late to do anything serious with it. 
I’m still trying extremely hard at everything but I know the facts, I will continue to be mediocre (at best) for ever. This just adds to depression and other insecurities and makes life feel worthless. 

Does anyone else feel like this"
119,"in a rut, ending it all seems ideal",depression,"this year has been tough for me. For the past 4 months I have done nothing but avoid it by playing games and by sleeping excessively. Whenever I hear anything school-related I get reminded of my current state and lose interest at whatever I was doing at that moment. Nothing seems to interest me anymore and waking up everyday doesn't seem like its worth it anymore. My mother often tells me that she feels like im always sad.  I always brush it off and say something like, ""its nothing"". I get mad much easier than before and I keep doing things like punching my desk or kicking my bed post. I am so tired of doing anything in general and offing myself has been on my mind daily now. I've had these thoughts of ending it all for about a year and a half now but it is more prominent in my mind now more than ever. My life seems to have no worth anymore and i really wish i could give it to someone who really wants to live. I stumbled upon this sub and i thought could share my thoughts as well. 
Sorry for the bad english, i really haven't studied it at all anymore."
120,I've decided I want to end my life,depression,"I'm almost 25 and it has become clear to me that I want to end my life.

When I was around 15, it became clear I wanted a university degree. I was an underachiever in school and my mother kept pushing me to drop out of school. She would scream and insult me when I resist. But I kept fighting back to stay in school, often involving counsellors to defend me because I felt I wouldn't be listened to if I spoke myself.

I didn't meet the requirements for university. My mother pushed me into a graphic design course I did for 6 months, then I pushed back into a university preparation course, then she pushed me into an arts degree after I completed the university preparation course, I did that for a year even though I didn't want to, then pushed back and started a Computer Science degree.

As you can see, there was no clear plan. Just two different conflicting ideals. But sadly for her, it is my life so she can fuck off and stop controlling it.

I did a year of a Computer Science degree. I consider going to university and doing a degree of my own choice the proudest thing I've ever been proud of -- because my mother made it her mission to make sure it doesn't happen. Yelling at me to give up and forget it.

The process of staying in school and going to university was a hurtful and intense experience which redefined what I want out of life, and my parent's roles in my life. It didn't happen once; it happened every year from 15 onwards until I no longer needed to rely on them. My sister believes my mother did nothing wrong and believes I'm just blaming her -- I believe she's just too blindly loyal to see any wrongdoing in my mother's behaviour.

After a year of my degree, I fell into deep depression and left university for 2 years. One year I was on the welfare, the next year I worked at a supermarket (grocery store). They didn't appreciate me there. I was honest about my struggles with mental health early on, and had issues with talking to myself in the isle. It was a tough experience.

After that, I quit and came back to university.

I have an ongoing backward-thinking habit. I don't know where it comes from, but it has existed for my whole adult life. I continually think about people, places, and memories from my past, and feel a frequent urge to search them up online to see how they are now. I feel regret at hurting others and smile at the nicer memories. I still think about YouTube personalities I used to watch at about 10 years ago who haven't uploaded videos for years.

I've seeked out EMDR because I believed it was trauma. But now I'm not sure. I don't know why I continually live in the past, but I believe it is a lifelong habit I'm stuck with.

Now I'm almost 25 in a week. I've seen many of my peers in the 4 different courses at 3 different institutions I've done graduate, I'm watching peers from high school and university have babies and get married. Every day I'm just reminded of how far away my high school years ago, and watch as peers keep moving ahead with their lives.

Even if I do graduate and get a degree, so what? I'm still going to keep looking backwards forever.

I've decided I don't want children because the inability to move on from past experiences isn't practical.

I've also had a lot of fun in my youth and it seems from here, it gets a whole lot more boring.

So I don't really see much point in being alive anymore.

I want to end my life and just write on my suicide note that if there is a funeral, my sister and mother aren't welcome, so they can have a good think about how they've treated me."
121,At what point should self harm/ suicide be considered mandatory for me?,depression,"I am quite the pathetic person, I have failed at everything I ever tried to accomplish. Everything that I do is done with such little skill and grace that its honestly an afront to society.

Every now and then I will self harm, because in my mind I see it as a way to enact justice when no one else will. No one punishes me for my failures and incompetence so I must do it myself. I will do this in regard to any failure as long as it isn't inconvient for someone else. For example when playing videos games and doing poorly I'll make sure to either physically abuse myself or emotionally abuse myself with insults about my pathetic nature, or how I would be better off dead. I know this is hard to understand for most people, my friends usually respond with phrases such as ""its only a game"" or ""why play a game if you don't have fun."" The problem is that its not just a game its a reflection of myself and my worth. If I can't do well in a something that's just a game even when I try doesn't that show that I can't do well in anything? Games are made to be completed or done well in, yet I can't do it. To me it seems like everyone has something they are good at, the problem is that I don't. Moving on from video games I tried to learn how to draw but couldn't, even with the extra motivation to do well in order to avoid physical abuse I just couldn't do well.

I have already made the conclusion that I will die by suicide one day, but should that date be pushed closer to the present to avoid polluting the world with my stench? I just don't know, google doesn't really have any answers to questions about how much self hatred, and self harm is required in order to balance out the bad aspects of myself so I came here.

Sorry for the post but thank you to anyone that answers."
122,Help please,depression,"Hi guys! I'm trying to push myself to say to a person about my feelings, but sometimes, I'm just thinking about - do I really need this... And I don't want to get to friendzone once again... So, say me shoul I do it or no, and if yes - say me the day in december when I should do it. I'm girl."
123,Today is going to suck,depression,"Decided to log some of my thoughts, I am currently stuck in a toxic cycle for the past 3+ years and it’s wearing me out. I hope that writing/typing this down will help me get out. Doing this makes me feel like I’m dissenting to madness but who knows. 

Today is going to suck. I haven’t gotten any sleep and school is in an hour, after that work until 11:30, by then I would be up for 32 hours without sleep. Because of my self destructive habits I was up scrolling thru my phone picking at my face again, causing red spots all over my face. I wouldn’t be surprised if people thought I was an addict but it’s just my terrible habits/depression.

Hopefully today is a good day."
124,All I want is to treat myself the way I try treat others,depression,"Logically, I know I’m not a bad person. At worse I’m probably average. But no matter what I do, I feel like all I do is take from the world and those I love. I feel like all I do is make the world a worse place simply by existing. 

I feel like my job and livelihood are constantly under threat. Like I’m never more than a week away from losing absolutely everything. It’s fucking terrifying. I wake up sobbing every morning around 4am. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore"
125,A guy in my college did take the last step....and no one seemed to care.,depression,"About a month or so ago, a guy in my college commited suicide. I didn't know him, but I had few mutuals with him apparently. We were all in our homes at this point and the dorms were empty, bar a few people. This guy was one of them, and he did it. 
The lack of any sort of remorse from anyone.....
I didn't know this guy one bit, but my heart aches for some reason thinking about him, because I have issues too. His 'friends' just sent your good ol 'omg rip I never saw this coming'. I thought maybe that was their way of processing grief, but na, there was no grief. I spoke on call with two of his friends after a week, and they didn't even seem to remember almost! Few of them legit were partying about something 3 days later! No one even bothered to contact or check up on his family. No one paid any tributes. All they said were 'oh yea he was a quite guy' etc. I mean....this just pains me so much. Is this how it is? Does no one really care? I'm supposing he struggled a lot, couldn't open up to his parents, and his friends were useless, as seen here. I expected atleast something. You need to move on...but this? This genuinely broke my heart. I wish I knew that guy when he was here. Rest in peace buddy."

127,A poem I've been writing over the past few weeks. I really hope it helps someone out there.,depression,"ignore the hateful words in your head

it's who you are that we love

nobody wants you dead

recognize the love that surrounds you

and really take to heart

the strength that others give you

while your world falls apart."
128,How to reach out?,depression,"Hey everyone,

How do you reach out for help? I'm sure many of you struggle to do this, but to those who have been able to take this step ... how did you do it?

I feel so incapable of opening up to my close friends about whenever I'm feeling fucking horrible and want to kill myself (which is nearly 95% of the time). Even my best friend, I never tell him ever how I am doing. It's not that I don't trust him, I trust him 100% but I can't seem to do it. I can't seem to ever reach out. What's the point of having friends if you can't support one another?

I feel really alone. I feel like I really lack a solid support system. I'm scared one day I'll just end it all. I just want to disappear and not feel like this."
129,Tired of being depressed,depression,"I'm 35(m). This is my first post, so please be kind if I make any mistakes. I wake up every day so damn depressed. I'd rather just sleep the day away because sometimes my dreams are so much better than what I wake up to. Every day I dread facing the day because I have to pretend to be happy, and I have to pretend everything is all right. When, in reality, I feel like I'm dying inside.  One of the worst feelings in the world for me is keeping myself from bursting into tears in public because I'm so fucking sad. I feel so alone all the time! Usually, I turn to music to feel something and that usually works, but this year has been so fucking hard. Music doesn't seem to work too well anymore, especially since the music I like is tied to a girl I met a few years back. I really like this girl, but it seems like she can't stand me sometimes, and I'm afraid to say anything because she'll toss me away like trash...I can't say that I blame her. I've hidden how bad my depression is from her because I feel ashamed of it and I don't want to cry in front of her, and I'm sure that will give her a better excuse to push me away. I know, ultimately, that it's not her responsibility to make me happy. I know it's up to me, but I don't know how. I hate my life! I hate my life! I don't know if this is just me screaming into the darkness or if anyone truly cares. Well, I ""know"" people do care, but I really wish I could feel it.  I don't have a bad life, and I'm on the verge of at least achieving some of my goals, but I just feel so damn empty. I need to look into getting into therapy, I guess. To be clear, I'm not suicidal, but if a bus hit me tomorrow, I would be okay with it. BUT I know I can't really let that happen because I have many miles to walk before I sleep, and many promises to keep. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. What should I do besides looking into therapy? I don't know."
130,Nothing even makes me happy anymore,depression,"For years I've felt like shit. I feel down everyday. I look in the mirror, and I hate what I see in myself. Nobody likes me. I'm an asshole a lot of the time, then I hate myself for it. I go to bed really late, sleep for 11, 12 hours, and I still want to stay in bed and do nothing. I go to bed real late because I hate the idea of having to wake up tomorrow and having to wade through a river of shit.

Playing videogames doesn't make me happy like it used to. I watch television and I just get distracted and can't focus. I usually end up doing nothing all day, just staring around my computer. I can play the piano, but after 10 minutes I'm bored. 

It feels strange though. I'm a straight A student who takes all-honors and I work ~18 hours a week. I excercise and I eat right. It feels like I have my life on track, but even then I still feel this way. 

My whole life has felt like this strange blur of events and I'm barely there for it. My memory's awful and I really can't remember most of middle school, like others can, despite just being done with it.

Of course, I have my ups and downs. Probably about once a week I think about killing myself, but I don't want to leave my mom like that.

I just want to feel OK, maybe even happy. The one thing that actually made me happy was this girl, and things felt like they were going well, so I asked her out. She said no and I just feel hopeless. I think Im not going to be happy for the rest of my life. I always feel like Im just going through the motions, and I cant enjoy any part of life.

Sorry if this was incoherent and a rambling mess, and thanks if you actually read it. I wrote this at 3am of course, because I dont want to do ""tomorrow."""
131,How do I know I’m not just really lazy?,depression,"My mom, who I live with, told me today that she tells people I clean the house all the time so they don’t think I’m as lazy as I am. I’m 28f and been diagnosed with depression since I was 15. I’m still at home, I don’t have a job and I can’t get a job because of my depression/anxiety etc. Ive been trying to get on disability for a few years now but of course, it’s very difficult. 

I never feel like doing anything. If I could, I’d be in bed 24/7. I do small chores around the house but I don’t do much of anything and I obviously can’t pay rent. What if I am just really lazy? How do I know this is just my depression? I feel like I’m making excuses by saying it’s my depression."
132,Today is going to suck,depression,"No one to blame but myself, with my self destructive habits today is going to be rough. Start school in an hour, then work until 11:30 at night, about 32 hours of no sleep. Started picking at my face like always and now skin looks terrible. 
Go to a job I don’t enjoy, legit have no friends. 

Less sleep = more negative thoughts for me 

Sounds like I’ve been doing drugs but it’s just self destructive behavior because of depression"
133,done,depression,"im so fucking broken and done. the last few years I've been bouncing around the country looking for a place to belong and can't find it. the latest place I've been living was okay. but recently I found out that my iPad was connecting to my neighbors Apple TV because I forgot the bluetooth was on. they saw me looking at porn like fetish stuff like stepmom and kink stuff. I heard them talking about it outside my window. idk why I look at it I suspect I was sexually abused as a kid and repressed it but idk. there's parts of my childhood I don't remember and my brother came out and said he was raped as a child by a church member and I think they got me too and I made myself forget. anyway I know for a fact my neighborhood is aware because of how they react to me. I don't think I can bounce back from this. my girlfriend broke up with me because my mental illness is too much for her and she's been carrying me the last two months because I got fired from my job . my life is just a series of short term dissapointments and rejection. my family I don't talk to anymore because they were abusive evangelicals who beat me with a horse crop because 'spare the rod spoil the child"" and are racist hateful alt right Christian nationalists. I don't have money for therapy and I don't think it would help anyway. there's no point to this. I feel like depression is gonna win this one. I'm not supposed to be here and I still have that stupid voice telling me to keep going but then I think what's the point its not like its gonna get better. people think and know I'm a fucking freak. a social reject. a degenerate,. a lowlife. I can't go out in public because I feel judgment every where I go. I tried hanging myself to see if that would feel like. and I felt lightheaded and numb. it felt good. no friends. no hope no future. the world will get worse anyway. I tried making music and my neighbors said it was shit. serves my narcissistic ass right being delusional thinking I was gonna go anywhere. I'm a loser and I deserve this. I make people feel bad just by being here. antisocial piece of shit. I just want acceptance but I find it nowhere. my boss even told me I don't belong here before I was fired. and I always remember what some hillbilly told me when I was 19. ""you aint shit boy and you never will be."" they were right and I was in denial."
134,"Just remembered something an old therapist noticed about me, and it sums up my issues really nicely",depression,"
I have had a couple of rounds of therapy (college counselling) in the past due to I’d say relatively mild depression and anxiety, and I remembered a little moment with one of my therapists that really hit me hard. I can’t remember exactly what we were talking about, something really depressing about myself, like how I feel unloveable or something like that, and she laughed to herself and then had this really guilty look on her face. She then apologised to me, and I asked what for.

She said that she’d laughed at what I said involuntarily because I have this habit of smiling and kind of laughing off whatever I’m saying whenever I’m talking about my feelings, and that she always kind of struggles not to laugh along with me and has to remind herself that I’m talking about some serious stuff, no matter how much she wants to laugh at a joke or smile back at me. She said I’ve got an infectious kind of smile though that she supposed people would just want to smile along with and not call out, as she even felt herself doing it too and she was a professional. She asked me if I noticed that I done this, but I honestly never had, at least not consciously. I have always used humour as a defence mechanism, but it’s weird to think that any time I open up to someone I actually will smile and laugh while I’m telling them how low I feel, how I feel pathetic, etc. 

I dunno, it was just weird having someone notice something like that. I’ve always felt people don’t take me seriously, and I assume that’s probably a large part of it. The fact that even when I’m being completely serious and probably feel on the verge of tears, I still have this inclination towards smiling, appearing friendly, joking around and putting people at ease. It’s like I literally don’t want people to be let in on the fact I’m a real person with actual emotions, even though I feel like a wreck, and just want to seem detached and joke about it all constantly, keeping people at arms length rather than opening up to them in any serious way. I never open up to anyone, and it’s hilarious to me that even when I try I can’t help but detach from it in some way and use humour to deflect. It really kind of summed up for me in one observation exactly where a lot of my issues stem from."
135,i'm failing university and i don't know what to tell my parents,depression,"I've never failed a thing in my life, but my depression finally kicked me into submission. I've been too tired and too afraid to do pretty much all of my classwork, and now i'm about to fail pretty much every class of my freshman year of university. I don't know what to do. I can only try to clean up them mess i left behind but i know its no use. I'm going to fail at least half of my classes and i'm helpless to do anything. 

my main problem is i have no clue what to tell my parents, who supported me this whole time financially. They told me i wouldn't be ready for uni, and they were right. I'm going to try and call my therapist, who i haven't spoken to at all since i came here, and ask her what i should do but besides that i feel hopeless. The only thing that keeps me from breaking down into a fit of sobs and dark thoughts constantly is my coping mechanism of distracting myself which only makes things worse.

I don't know what to tell my parents besides ""i was too sad and tired to do my work so now im begging for your acceptance. I don't need forgiveness because i wouldn't forgive myself either. I'm so sorry i fucked up so bad"""
136,Why do I feel alone?,depression,I’m a 20 year old male who doesn’t know by he’s alone even when he’s which the one he loves. Why am I stuck in this dark oblivion of existence? How can I get out of it?
137,"I’m feeling very hopeless in my job and life situation in general, and I want to say some things.",depression,"Or something. At all. I’ve been drowning the feelings in food and substances for awhile and I no longer have the option to do that, and I feel even worse than I thought I would.             
     
My job is a good job, but it’s bad for me. Someone else would do better in my work position. I work at a teeny store that has never had more than 3 employees, and I’m currently the only employee. The other employee got promoted to a management position so now there’s two owners, one manager, and me: the one who scrubs the toilets, cleans floors, and does the grunt work. I started this job with two coworkers and two bosses, and now I have 0 coworkers and 3 bosses. Also, I’ve worked here longer and generally have more experience in this field AND as a manager in this field than the new manager, which is a little insulting.            
        
My home life also isn’t bad, but it kind of sucks. I’ve been living in a studio with my SO for 2 years and it’s just too small. It’s impossible to keep clean. I work all year and they only work during the summer, and they refuse to clean when they’re home for the winter. I can keep the place clean enough for short term guests during the summer, but when both of us with all of our stuff is there, it’s too much for me to keep up with. It sucks to clean all day at work and come home to a dirty house. I can only rarely find the will to clean after working all day, and coming home to a dirty house every day is taking a toll. My SOs issues are also a factor and I don’t completely blame them, but I wish they would try more. I’ve communicated this.          
         
And finally, my chronic pain is becoming unmanageable, but committing a day off to waiting for a doctor to find a solution seems worse than dealing with it. I’m at a point where I can’t handle being at work late for 10 minutes without having a break down, and a doctors appointment on my few days off seems impossible. I haven’t left the valley I live in since may, and I haven’t had an actual trip in 2 years, and I haven’t had a vacation in 5 years. I value my days off and I NEED them. And I hear so many horrible stories from others with chronic pain about how doctors just accuse them of wanting painkillers or write their symptoms off completely. I can’t handle that right now. Something needs, NEEDS to be done about my pain because I’m getting to a point where I can’t function at work, but fucking DAMMIT this shit is  such a god damn hindrance!                  
               
 I feel incapable of doing what I need to do in order to keep myself alive and it’s so god damn frustrating! i want to live most of the time! Why can’t my mind and body cooperate? I know what I need to do and how to do it, so why is it that I CANT? Look for a new job, be adamant about moving house with my partner, go to the doctor. Why is it all so hard? ): This isn’t my first experience with depression, i mean it never really went away to begin with. But I forgot how bad it could be."
138,Why am I so much Lesser than others?,depression,Why am not good as others? I feel like a worthless piece of shit. I wish I were dead. No matter how much I improve myself it seems I’ll never be enough. I’ll always be lesser than the person I want to be. I don’t want to live anymore
139,My parents are splitting up,depression,"I was just minding my business and my mom comes in and tells me that she and my dad are splitting up, this is the last straw I swear I’m gonna Fucking snap"
140,I can't do this,depression,"My life has gone to shit in all ways you can think of. I got fired from my job, I lost a friend, I'm failing all my classes, I am dealing with weight issues, bullying, you name it. It has been going on for about a year and I just can't. I fucking can't. The will to live is no longer. I don't want to commit suicide or anything but I just don't feel like living. Each day I get up later than the day before. I'm waking up sometimes at 2 in the afternoon. I don't go outside, I don't have many friends to talk to, and videogames are pretty much the only thing there for me. My parents are giving up on me. I'm so close to saying ""fuck it"" and just quit. I don't know what to do. I feel like I fell in a hole of madness that I can't get out of. When I get pissed I can myself by playing video games. Videogames are my escape from reality and that is all I have. Every problem I run into I put it off and it slows me down even more and bringing more problems with it."
141,Life is so hard,depression,"I just started working recently (2 weeks ago) and it had been a while since I worked before this job. I had just moved states and was trying to land on my feet and then corona hit. It took me 11 months to find a job and during these 11 months I tried to remain positive. But recently one of my roommates tested positive for COVID. I had to inform my workplace, and since I was seasonal, I was let go. On top of all of this I had my last interview with Sony for an internship on Tuesday this week. Since I now have a COVID roommate I was told I cannot do the interview. As soon as I begin to do good in life everything gets taken away from me. Life is so hard I never want to kill my self but the thought of going to sleep and not waking up is so blissful. Sorry for the rant I just needed to get it off my chest :("
142,Heartache loneliness,depression,"This is my first time typing here...I generally surf this subreddit to feel relatable but now today my heart has pains that i never felt before.

I been having trouble with someone im very close to. I couldnt face him alone so i got a friend in a similar depressive as me to help. We succeded but turns out this reminded him of his own issues.

Resolving this someone problem made me feel very depressed and i wasnt 100% focus to help my friend. I tried convincing him to come back but he wouldnt and now...he may be gone forever.

I know i should respect his decision but it gives me so much heart pain that i never feel before. Now im alone...again."
143,I've lost my hope in life,depression,"I feel depressed everytime,I just want a hug or to talk with someone who will understand my feelings.
       I have no money to go to a pyschiatrist,I want to die so badly but iam afraid to,iam literally crying sitting in a corner out here.I just wanna talk to someone before I hurt myself bad."
144,my dreams are better than my reality,depression,and i wake up miserable. the one person i wish i could spend my life with is married with a child lol and much older. i have borderline personality disorder so i struggle with this emptiness inside me 24/7. i wish i could live in my dreams forever because the moment i wake up and realize my reality i start fucking crying.
145,dont know what to do anymore,depression,just like most people i have my ups and downs but lately everything seems to put me down. im tired at failing and being a failure just not one person understands that going on with anxiety and whatever the hell this horrible feeling is i just cant keep focusing on everything else because knowing im not ok but feeling like i have no one to go to sucks . and my life aint even half as bad as someone elses but everyones problems are bigger to them than it might seem to you but at the same time i feel guilty asking for help...
146,It's exhausting going on when everyone hates you,depression,"I just turned 60, and I'm a failure however you define it. (I did manage to get a masters degree about four years ago). I suppose I've always known, but, now, being fired again on my 60th birthday I feel I have to accept that the people I know don't like me and sometimes genuinely hate me. I've been amazed how much someone can hate me when they hardly know me and I've done nothing I can see to make them so angry. (A professor, coworker, boss, for example) Sometimes, they don’t just hate me--they despise me. I've been told I come off as arrogant, which I don't understand. I've mentioned this to some people and they don't understand either why people think I'm arrogant). I don't ever say anything out of the ordinarily, or unkind, or boastful, mean, whatever. I have no friends. I've had long healthy relationships with girlfriends, and it's different with them. It's just hard to know that finally at my age I just need to accept that no one really wants me around and most people will genuinely dislike me. I don't need anyone to tell me that my depression is messing up my self-image or perception in general. I'm guessing that some people dislike like right here---as they're reading this. Maybe people think I'm just whining or feeling sorry for myself or has warped social skills. I'm also not a narcissist. I'm a mental health counselor,  and this never seems to be a problem with my clients. I'm close to my family. (I am a major depressive, and I've been taking meds for about 20 years, and they do seem to eork.)"
147,School depression,depression,"So I’m on my junior year and I don’t understand how people can enjoy school or not be extremely depressed and stressed out about it. Everything about it is horrible. The people, the grades, the homework and tests and quizzes. 
How can I enjoy school or at least not be extremely depressed because I have to go to school the next day? My grades are decent but I feel I waste so much time doing school work when I could be doing something that I enjoy."
148,Getting bad again is so confusing(24f),depression,"It's really hard for someone that's getting older and recognizing the feelings so quickly. Losing interest, struggling to be happy in the good moments, seeing the worried looks and reactions from people around you. Like it still feels like someone else is taking the reigns and is just trying to make me feel worse. You can work so hard to eat, drink, and be active. But it still lingers. I know it gets better because I've felt it before, but I wish it was more manageable. I wish I could feel these things and make a U turn, but it's all trial and error. Right?"
149,Im 26 and im tired...,depression,"I'm 26, Male and i have a story to tell.
I'm writing this on 11-30-20. My birthday
Yay happy b-day to me....
Life honestly doesn't feel the same anymore and im getting closer to that numb feeling I've heard alot about. I've been a trooper my whole life. I always kept my chin up with a smile. Maybe people just wanted to see me break down?

Heres a back story about myself before i jump into why you clicked on this.

Lifes been pretty shitty. I've had my up's and great times but most of my life has been nothing but hard times. 
My grandfather owned a business and my dad worked for him. 
So you could say i lived the middle class life growing up. 
We weren't rich but my parents always treated us to stuff when we deserved it.
My problems aren't financial related.

I didn't have many friends.  
Throughout my life i maybe had 10 friends? 
It doesn't matter now because as it stands right now i only have 2 friends. 
I was bullied from the 2nd grade -7th grade. 
I was just a target to alot of kids. 
One day in the 5th grade my older brother passed away from a heart condition that runs in the family. 
Its called prolonged qt syndrome just incase you were curious.

My teacher obviously found out and she had the whole class write me ""feel better"" cards they made from the classes art supplies but my bully was also in that class. 
I'll never forget what that bully said to me the day after my brothers funeral.
He laughed at me and said ""Your brothers dead"".
I mentally snapped and blacked out.
I only remember being pulled off him by the teacher.
I was punished for it ultimately while he got away scott free because his friends lied for him.

One day in the 7th grade, i finally had enough and snapped on one of the guys who wouldn't leave me alone.
 He was walking behind me and slapped me in the back of the head for no reason at all. 
At that very moment, i already had the thought of ""I've had enough of people's shit"" running through my mind.
 Not in the school shooter type of way, but in a way i would finally stand up for myself against people who made me a target. 
So when he hit me i just let loose. 

I ended up breaking his ankle. 
He was heavy set guy. 
I'd say he was 5'4 and 320 pound easy.
i stepped on his foot with all my weight and pushed him sideways. 
Well, that landed me in hot water obviously.
 I got in way more trouble than him even though i was fighting back against a bully who did nothing but mentally and physically abuse me. 
He got to stay in school and they put me in a Behavioral Disorder school or ""BD school"" as most call it.  
I ended up dropping out my sophomore year because i was just done with life and everyones shit.

The fact that i was in trouble for doing the right thing for myself created one hell of a ride for me in the future and I'm at equal fault for the results these experiences yielded. 
I could have handled things better in life.

(So now that you have some what of a bio of myself, let me get to major points)

Around late 2011, early 2012 i ended up in my first relationship surprisingly.
 She treated me with respect, love and everything else a healthy relationship brings to the table. 
I found this to be odd at first because of how negative people have been to me.
 I grew used to this and thats where i fucked up. 
I let my guard down completely and told her why i felt misunderstood my whole life. 

I felt misunderstood because no matter what i did to defend myself or to please others i always got looked at like i did something wrong. 
Not just by my peers, but also people my age.
I felt like a total outcast my whole life.
The relationship only lasted a little under 2 years. Towards the end of that relationship i was going through another rough patch.

I found out she was cheating on me. 
I was angry, upset and didn't know why she would do that to me. 
I initially exploded verbally towards her. I could have handled myself better thinking about it now but what she did next is just cold.

I begged for her back, pleaded and poured my heart out to her over the phone. 
She laughed and handed the phone to her new toy.
(I only say new toy because she was with him for like 2 weeks lol)
The guy she was cheating with was sending me voice clips on messenger. 
I knew him, he was a Friend of a friend and i was at his house a couple times. 
Most of them consisted of him gloating about how he stole my girlfriend. 

I got to a boiling point, snapped again and went to his house without warning.
Instead of banging on the door, i kicked it repeatedly.
After the first few kicks he opens the door and i shove him back inside so i can close the door behind me. 
This way nobody could see what i was about to do to this guy.

 I beat the ever living shit out of him.
He never called the police on me either surprisingly. 
My ex made me out to be this psychopath after that but 
She was just mad that i beat up her new boyfriend.
He really did ask for it in my opinion.
the rumors she spread were pretty serious because they effect me till this day. 
She claimed without a single mark on her body to prove it, that i had beat her after i beat up the boyfriend.

I still had most of my friends. 
Me and my ex were in the same small circle so it made it a bit more tough for all of us to hang out as a group after that. They knew i only beat the shit out of him.


We skip forward to 2018 and it brings us to a similar story about another ex. The relationship starts out great, she cheats and ofcourse i wanted her back.
( im hopeless i know)
We got back together and this was just a bad idea because it just became toxic after that.
 I was no longer happy but she didn't want me to leave her.  

She went full blown psychotic and started hitting, scratching and bitting herself. I was genuinely freaked the hell out and physically picked her up and put her outside.  
Her sister came and got her and when she did i quickly put her stuff outside my front door so she couldn't get back in. 
Can you guys guess whats coming next?
She claimed i beat her and her sister not only believed her but spread it around town.

This was hit of epic proportions to my reputation because not only was my last ex part of our circle, this one was too and they both now claimed that i beat them and both of these rumors spread like wildfire after the 2nd one. 
We skip to 2020 and all of my friends are gone except for 2. 
All of them just blocked me at random times and never said a word.
Like 10+ years meant nothing.

My grandpa died from a medical procedure this year too. 
We hung out everyday. 
I would get off work about 3pm and go to his store and on my days off i would go spend time with him.
We would always talk about stuff that was on our mind.
He knew what i was going through and he was there with me every step of the way.
Now that my grandpa is gone i can feel the need to go with him becoming stronger.
It feels like life just takes what little i have left and makes it dissappear and for what? I didn't do much wrong in my life
But thats just how the cookie crumbles.

The moral of the story is don't say false things about people. It can hurt them in more ways than you realize.

I can't save myself anymore and i know how this going to end for me but maybe it will get the message out there to help stop this from happening to others....

Thanks for reading my mental break down.."
150,Serious question; does it actually get better?,depression,"I'm about to be 20.

Tonight I sit in my mom's basement tonight eating ice cream and watching youtube clips while not writing my final essay that is already late.

I have relapsed on my addiction as well as all my positive habits I have been trying to build for the last month and a half.

Since I was ten I've been in and out of therapist offices, 5 of them in total. The first two were forced and the last three I sought on my own.

My friends are all stem nerds I still know from high school, one has a job at tesla already while in school, one is about to get an internship at Lockheed, the other works in IT.

I am a virgin community college student who failed last semester and is pursuing a history degree that won't even get me a job.

I'm just tired. No matter how hard I try nothing fundamentally changes. I have been attempting different regimens and good habits for literally years. I always start out attempting to eat right, sleep before 6am, go for walks, stop procrastinating, stop watching porn, etc. This inevitably fails every single time as it did after this month.

maybe it's just the illness talking, but I am starting to think it really doesn't get better. Is life worth living if it's just an endless struggle to feel normal or good about myself?

If my whole life is destined to be a struggle against myself, why should I keep going? Whats the point?"
151,Tired of all this pain,depression,I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I been depressed since 9 and I’m now 15. My family mentally abused me calling me names and my mom called me a mistakes which made me suicidal. I attempted suicide multiple times but I was scared. I love my cousins because they  made me happy and they game with me but my parents hates it when I play games and hang around them. School adds more stress and make me more depressed. I’m not motivated for school. I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom wants me to enrolled in the military but I’m pretty sure that gonna lead to ptsd for me. I was planning to leave at 18 but I’m gonna need a job but I’m not motivated for school. When I was younger I got beaten for no reason and sometimes it’s wasn’t even my fault. I’m just tired of all this pain.
152,Sleep issues got me again,depression,"I haven't posted on here for a while. Since high school I started noticing / forming bad sleep habits. Some of it was my fault for overworking myself, sometimes it was circumstantial due to my living situation or work I couldn't get out of. And probably most frustrating of all, my sleep problems can stem from factors that are hard to pinpoint like anxiety, depression, or even little health things like allergies.

I'd usually post on r/insomnia, but it tends to be more about finding solutions (which is fair). I mostly just wanted to vent, because it's 4:35 am. I can barely do anything and have been trying to sleep since 11:00 pm. Once I reach this state, I realized that I failed and will probably wake up sometime in the afternoon again. I feel a large sense of sadness for all the time I lost from lack of sleep over the years. Missing all the mornings. The time adds up. Sometimes I wonder how things could have been if I were to have that time back; would I have been a better person?"
153,I can’t stop damaging my skin,depression,"I feel so alone and repulsive. I get so pissed off and upset whenever someone claims they have issues with skin picking... and they show a couple spots about 1mm in circumference on their face. It feels like such a mockery that people will pop a pimple and go teehee I’m disordered. Bitch I’m so overwhelmed all the time that my face and back are DESTROYED there are literally craters in my face. It’s not cute or funny, I fucking hate myself more every day"
154,Shit ending to a shit holiday.,depression,"Thanksgiving is my favorite. It was very different this year. I cooked a huge feast for my husband, my daughter, and her SO. Husband and daughter have a very rocky relationship (he is not her bio dad). As soon as dinner is ready, all hell broke loose and she’s in her room crying because he’s so mean. Which sets him off even more. He went hunting for the weekend, and I literally did nothing but lay around and binge tv. And food. So depressed. He got home late last night, we talked a little. He gets up this morning in a shit mood, which I can hear him grumbling while I’m still in bed. Then I hear him saying OMG OMG OMG. I go running into the living room and there is our cat. Dead.  She was old, but didn’t seem sick. Fuck. I’m dreading having to tell my daughter- we’ve had her her whole life. Fuck, again."
155,There’s no point lmao,depression,"Granted I’m drunk but fuck there’s no point. No point to being alive, having friends, having a life. Like what the fuck. What the fuck is the point. Can someone try and talk me off the ledge?"
156,Fuck it sucks so much being lonely,depression,I used to have a lot of friends until my recent relationship where I was manipulated and lied to and lost everything and everyone and now I’m just so lonely and don’t know who to trust anymore and now I’m extremely lonely it’s so hard to make friends anymore
157,I feel like I'm in a void,depression,"So all my life everyone in my life has left me ( Mom, Dad, Siblings, Bestfriends Family) so now I'm living with my grandparents and it miserable they complain about everything thing I do. It like I can't do anything right even though I do so much. My life is very uneventful and due to my past it's hard to feel loved no one in my family has really shown it to me but then this one girl come into my life and she show me actual love and I feel amazing but then she leaves me for my bestfriend. Thing suck I'm failing all my classes and I've honestly got no one my grandparents and I have nothing in common and they always lecture me about everything so I don't like talking to them. But then I decided that I won't go anywhere emotionally if I don't find love so I go to the state where my mom and sisters live and it makes it even worse they barely spend time with me when I'm there and it just makes me feel even more empty. Then i move back with my grandparents for a better education even though its emotional numbing So then I try to get a girlfriend and it works! But what I didn't know was that it was my new bestfriends ex so when he found out about I had to make a choice so I choose my bestfriend. I the emptiness filling my heart. Then I expand my friends into a squad which make me feel good but my grandparents are strict so I can barely go out anymore and no one talks to me so I've been feeling like there's a void inside of me. And I just don't know what to do anymore. Nothing helps but Music."
158,"school is fun, they said",depression,"I have 20+ overdue assignments, make up work, i'm dying, this sucks man, anyone else in high-school rn? why did i join ap classes? that's because I wanted to prove myself to my mom, and now I'm gonna dissapoint her more, what am I even doing? this just sucks, i'm failing most if not all classes"
159,Today’s gonna be a bad day. Can anyone help?,depression,"I’m in quarantine, been up since 2am, I know I’ll waste today away in bed like I did with the past week.
Any advice on what to do to feel less like an absolute failure?
I just want to be productive and feel accomplished but I don’t know how."
160,Cliche topic but dealing with rejection,depression,"Honestly I’m building myself back up from rock bottom and I got this new job and a cute girl works there. I’m too much of a loser to be worth dating but I kinda sorta tried to flirt with her anyway. She made it ABUNDANTLY clear she’s not interested, just avoids me all the time or is terse. 

I feel so worthless, ugly, inferior. 

I’m getting back into shape and getting better with money. I just hope one day I can be super fit and super rich and look back and laugh that she missed out on giving me a chance."
161,I ruined the family holiday,depression,My depression has just made me a miserable cloud and I brought it home and I ruined my family’s holiday. I was so mean and cold all week taking everything out on them. It all blew up today and I just ruined everything. I wish I had the courage to kill myself. I don’t want to be this burden anymore. But I know I would make it worse if I did. I wish I could remove myself from their lives without them remembering me. I know they would be happier having never knew me. Unfortunately they know me and I’ve ruined their lives whether I live or die.
162,I just want to end it all,depression,It's currently 12:24 and I I had a project due yesterday before midnight but my fucking submission didn't turn it in. It was my last hope of passing the class but now I know I'm fucked. I hate college and I hate my life. I'm thinking about just taking some pills so I can sleep forever. I don't want to live anymore. I fucking hate college and I fucking hate my responsibilities. I'm done. I'm a failure in school and in life.
163,I hate this,depression,"Every fucking day I’m unmotivated, completely emotionless and hopeless about everything...just numb. My depression is getting worse. I’m going steadily downhill. I’m panicking. I can’t stop my mind from feeling like this. I can’t turn it off without killing myself. Fuck fuck, *FUCK*. I feel like I’m drowning. Somebody please help me"
164,"Can’t get out of bed, just wanna die in my sleep",depression,"I haven’t bathed in days, and as this week has gone by I get out of bed later and later and today I didn’t leave bed at all. In fact, I’m still in bed right now, covers over my head. I haven’t eaten since yesterday, nor have I gone to the bathroom or had any water. I just can’t. I hope when I close my eyes again that I just won’t wake up. Is that even possible? I wish it were."
165,INTIMACY ISSUES,depression,"I've been depressed pretty much all fucking year, but I know I am not alone.

This year has taken a toll on a lot of people.

One of the issues I've been having is related to intimacy. I'm gonna be real --- I'm a bitch that loves sex. But lately, I haven't been interested in anyone. I have no desire to have sex with anyone. I don't even get horny anymore, I don't have any interest in porn... fuck. I'm turning into a substitute teacher. I think my depression is completely killing my sex drive, which sucks because sex is one of the ways I like to be affectionate and creative. Why have I lost interest? Does anybody else run into the same issues, and do you think it is related to depression? Is there anything I can do to fix this? 

Thanks boys and squirrels, love y'all. #missingGOODsex"
166,Heartbreak having to bury your dreams.,depression,"The past couple of days have been a rollercoaster inside me. I've been feeling a deep ache in my chest that I've come to realize is mourning.

I regret making dreams and aspirations. It hurts all the more to realize they're not going to come true. Having to squeeze it smaller and smaller until it becomes barely a shell of what it was. 

It's ridiculous having to envision a lonely future for yourself. But I could see it. 

I hate mediocrity but that is what I am, neither too smart nor too dumb, just at the perfectly level plane of so-so. Despite knowing that I still couldn't let myself walk the line of mediocrity, because I know I'll always be plagued by thoughts of what ifs. 

But in doing so I continue to pursue a future that is well out of reach, one I can foresee will be paved by my blood, sweat and tears. 

It's daunting. It's lonely. But I couldn't quit this path because I wouldn't let me. 

I'm lazy, but I wouldn't let myself be lazy. I'm not smart, but I wouldn't allow myself to be stupid. My emotions have always been muted but I wouldn't let that stop me from showing I care. I'm not an instinctively good person, but I try to be. 

Life is hard. I wish I was a child again, where my biggest dreams were just to eat bacon and cheese pizza on the way home from school. 

I don't want to tell my parents I feel depressed. I know the root cause of it, it has always been due to instability and the unknown. Leaving things up to chance is horrifying, because I've never won in a game of chance. Constantly feeling hopeless is wearing me down. I just want to be happy again."
167,Can I be a horrible person?,depression,"Sometimes I wish I'd one day just say ""fuck morality"" and become something infamous. I want that healthy satisfying life but there are times where it just feels easier for me to just hurt people and then die. Maybe it's who I'm meant to be."
168,Depression relapse rant,depression,"Hello.

Writing here for the first time, since I feel like the return of my severe depression started ruining my personal relationships, again.

Now, I understand that it is still, of course, my fault if I don't keep my feelings in check, but I keep getting these awful, very hard to control mood swings. I don't quite know what to do with myself when I get hurt for little or no reason at all and get all sad and prickly and, at times, passive aggressive.

After one of those sudden little outbursts one of my friends basically made a point to tell me that I'm an emotional mine and I'm very hard to talk to, often, because of that. He said that he doesn't want to talk to me, at all, at times such as this and after these incidents.

The thing is, I struggle a lot right now, and having just all of my very few friends on top of that get sick of me just makes it worse, even though I totally respect their need to distance themselves from me or cut me out of their life completely. That whole conversation made me feel extremely guilty and I apologized as best as I could, though I still fucked up even in that, I think.

I also realized that I'm having suicidal thoughts again, after a long time of not having that problem.

I don't know what I'm seeking typing this now, but I just... don't know what to do and who to talk to. A therapist might be a good option, I suppose, but at this moment I don't feel like I have the strength to ask for an appointment. Everything stings and I can't bear the thought of telling about it all out loud. It feels like my whole life is crumbling around me and I don't have anyone or anything to hold on to. I am worthless and I don't think there's any point in continuing to exist as this pile of trash that nobody rightly wants to deal with. I don't want to hurt everyone around me anymore. 

I'm also failing at school and will most probably have to take a break for a year due to medical reasons, but this one night and one conversation just took away my remaining desire to live and try."
169,Shoes?,depression,Why do I constantly were mu shoes when I'm more depressed? I just noticed this about myself. Anyone else?
170,"I’ve been letting myself go, not taking care of me basically.",depression,"I’m 23(F) I am married as well, and lately because I haven’t had or recieved any help for most important things from my husbands family that I feel isolated and alone . I don’t talk to my own family , not a good family anyway. They have disowned me and I ended up moving to Europe with my husband who is from there . Right before the virus got really bad . Now we are living in a caravan because I can’t work yet. Rent is way to expensive anyway. His mother lives close by but can’t keep us there . His family is spread out all over the country and yet there isn’t room for us there anyway. Everything is on halt . He goes to school and I can’t do anything . I’m stuck inside or having to try my best to keep things sane . I also struggle with an ED and it’s been out of hand . Not taking care of myself , hardly eating and drinking rather then eating I guess . Drinking a lot , I have no worth of trying anymore . I feel like giving up. I don’t feel worthy of anyone or anything . I just don’t want to feel anything and I don’t want to become an alcoholic either . I’m just stuck here , isolated in my own brain. I try to talk to him , but I feel like he has given up on me . He just goes quite when I’m in my depressive state and says “I don’t know how to help. And anything I say just makes you upset .” Maybe it’s the fact that I’m trying to make him fall out of love so when I am finally , truly isolated - then it won’t hurt when I leave this world . Therapy isn’t an option since I am not even allowed to get insurance . Just wait until something happens. Anything . I don’t want to talk to anyone anymore . Just to leave slowly so they can just forget me . My toxic behaviors may be impacting anyone’s relationship with me anyway. And it’s okay, I’ll get over it once they are gone . Not sure what I can do at this point ."
171,Sometimes it just hits me,depression,Sometimes it just hits me that my life never happened and it never will. Too late to start over. Too empty to be ambitious. Too broken to be fixed.
172,Can't open up to anyone,depression,"I'm too scared to open up to anyone. Even tho I'm obviously depressed no one asks me. Seems rude that I want people to ask me instead of me telling them but it's just too hard to do. Maybe when I die people will realise what was going on in my stupid brain. What is the point in living on if every time you take one step forwards, depression pulls you back by 2. It's just a slow procedure of life bringing us down and down more and more. People aren't gonna even care. Why are people so mean?"
173,High-functioning depression,depression,"Darren again talking about his *life of struggle.* 

Few days ago I went to see a therapist to help me figuring out what was wrong with me. I talked about my childhood, my present, the ambivalent relationship with my mom and my so-not future. Basically what she concluded was the title of this post: high-functioning depression.

Something between the line of actually being beaten down by the disorder but also kept alive by my constant anxiety. She suggested to try to find my *lost spark, the fire that used to ignite my soul.*  As if it is easy. I go to work and I’m cheerful and smiley and funny, then I come home and pretend to tidy the house and then put on my pyjama and get to bed around 5pm everyday (even earlier, but that depends on my working schedule). She was very nice but I don’t think I will ever go back. She only managed to confirm my suspicions but didn’t actually suggested anything. Not even a walk during the afternoon. If you have a therapist, what kind of relationship do you have with them? Because I hated it. I was boiling with rage at some point and now I know that I’m just too functional to get classified as *depression* meaning that I’m a failure even with mental disordes."
174,Can’t wait for it,depression,"
I hate who I am. I hate what I am becoming. I hate that I cannot change and I hate that my heart is not as warm as I wish it to be and my soul as light as I thought it once was.

I want to hurt myself. I want to see what once was inside stream out in meandering waves of red disdain. 

I want to be loved, and I have wished for it so for long, without realising that I cannot be loved - the person that I am is not deserving of it. I finally have come to understand that after years of lying to myself through facades and daydreams.

I am no better than the people that I judge. 

It has reached the point where I feel as though I belong in this sense of self, in this sense of life and this particular journey. As much as I have tried to climb the ragged walls that cave me in this path, I seem to slip and fall at every manoeuvre. I have come to accept this now.

What keeps me here is guilt. I envision my five year old self staring up at me with her brown eyes, such innocence and unknowing of the choices she will one day make. Of the people that she will lose, the daydreams that she will realise are simply dreams and how the world is not as kind as she hoped it would be to her.

Even now I lie. 
I am not kind. I am not loving. I am not good. 

I am manipulative. I am selfish. I am envious. I am greedy, senseless, cold and a bitch. I am a hypocrite. 

And I have tried to change but I think this is who I will always be, no matter how hard I try or how many lists I make. 

As much as I wish I was a good person, I am not. 

I haven’t slept properly in days."

176,Putting in all your effort and hard work and failing... how to cope?,depression,"It's not chance either. The last 3-4 projects I have worked on (in a lead role) have been ciritical and commercial failures. Each time, i've attended lectures, asked for feedback, each time thinking i'd learned and grown. Still, nothing, still a failure each time. I feel completely defeated.

178,Don’t think I can go on much longer because of my height.,depression,I just measured myself and I’m barely 5 foot 9 1/2. I don’t even go outside because of my height. It’s absolutely embarrassing having all of my friends and everyone in public be taller than me. I just don’t get it either...my Dad is 6 foot and mom is 5 foot 4. Why am I the height I am? I’m gonna miss my friends and family a lot if I do go through with it.
179,I'm going to start being blunt,depression,"I have freaking autism so it affects the way I speak. I can't have good comebacks and stuff cause my brain is awful but I'm a be blunt, I don't care. It's better than keeping it inside.

I notice that most people project their issues into others, so far I used to self harm but I'm going to do the same, with the difference that I will project them to people who actually hurt me repeatedly on purpose and not on innocent people."
180,When does it get better when taking Zoloft?,depression,"I just started Zoloft yesterday and I don’t want to feel depressed anymore, this is horrible.

Please tell me the drug makes you better, how long until it works please?"
181,I still feel like I'm faking it.,depression,"I have hard to doing my studies and recently it's gone compltely out of control (usually gets bad during winter time). I haven't even looked at my txtbook for days when I know I should be prepping for the finals.

Things like this makes me think that maybe I'm faking it to avoid studying, to avoid doing things I dont necessarily enjoy.

I've been diagnosed already but I still feel like this bc I cant even try to try, if that makes sense. Feel like such a lazy and useless human with no self control."
182,"If we told kids from the get go, that pretty soon they would have to join Santa in the north pole, and become elves and work for the rest of their lives, that they would still want to be alive?",depression,"We feed children pipe dreams and lies about Christmas and about how reality is magical and all this bullshit.

Why don't we use Christmas as a helpful metaphor for how reality actually is? Why don't we just tell them that they have no choice but to go into Santas factory and work for the rest of their lives? Why do we leave this part out?? Since we are well aware that this is their likely life path, why the fuck even have children in the first place???"
183,I dropped out of college today,depression,"I'm 18. Failed my first semester out of high school. It wouldn't matter if my parents weren't paying. They said they pay for the next semester if I did it ""their way"" which means living under 100% surveillance while being guilt tripped and yelled at at and lectured and told I'm useless. 

So I dropped out. I decided I'd rather get a job, use the next few months to recuperate and discipline myself, save up the money and pay for next fall on my own. 

My dad's response to this? Telling me I'm going to be a ""homeless fuck"" and that I won't re-register in fall because he ""knows how this works"" and then screamed at me how I'm not going to amount to anything and I'm ruining my life. For the record where I live, as long as you register early you'll pretty much get whatever you want classes wise. Hell even if you do it late you'll be fine, if you can live with maybe a few wierd class hours. Maybe a few.

My mom's response. I'm paying rent (she said thirty percent of my paycheck) and I'm paying for my own food out of pocket. I also have to pay her and my father back for last semester because I got bad grades. I'm okay with this one. It's my fault for not being motivated enough.

I really could just care less for either of them. I just want to live my own life and pay them back the money for last semester. Or I could kill myself. I don't care. I just want the yelling to stop. I already know neither of them care. My dad just has no faith in me to accomplish anything and my mom only cares about money."
184,Stuff that’s on my mind,depression,"Sometimes I wonder why do we live just to die or what the meaning of life really is. I’m very impatient, so sometimes I try to end it so I could get out of this horrible and cruel world we live in because we are all gonna end up dying, and I would rather have that done earlier than usual."

186,Making progress(sort of),depression,"Two years ago today I was hospitalized and then transferred to a psychiatric facility after an attempted suicide. I was held there for the usual 72 hours and then allowed to go home. I felt like a failure. I just wanted to curl up into a ball and never come back. Sometimes I still feel that way. But I’m here, which is a lot more than I expected of myself, and I’m damn proud of it. 

So if you’re having a rough time, keep at it. All we can ask of ourselves is to do the best we can with what we’ve got."
187,I want to k*ll myself,depression,"Hi,

I’m sitting alone at a gas station 2AM and it’s kinda hitting me. I’ve been suicidal for a while on and off, but now it’s like i’ve hit the bottom. I just don’t see a point to life anymore. Days go by and everything feels hopeless. Every inch of happiness i feel just disappears like that. I can’t find the ability to feel happy for a longer period. It just ends when the day ends. Each night i’m left with a feeling of emptiness. Not trying to be all sappy here, I just don’t know who to talk to. Better to get everything out on a platform where nobody directly knows me. I haven’t talked to a professional yet and honestly idk what to say even if i do. Nothing traumatic has happened to me, nothing that explains why I don’t want to live anymore.

I feel like the only thing keeping me alive right now is that I can’t yet fathom the idea of not existing. I can’t imagine me being gone, for my family and friends. I have people that severly care about me and people that I care about, I’ve sen the way death affects people and I don’t want the people I care about to ever feel like that. So, don’t worry (idk if y’all are worrying tbh) this is not a suicide note. Just me pouring my night thoughts on this app. 

If you actually read this thank you, sorry if it’s triggering i just don’t know what to do anymore.

Sincerely, Z :)"
188,you cant be loved if you dont love yourself,depression,"this quote always makes me spiral

incoming relevant but also skippable story:
{{ i started life out shy, sensitive and introverted
when puberty hit i became very insecure because i was ugly and chubby.
nobody at school spoke to me because i had awful social anxiety.
i get into highschool and my anxiety isnt as crippling but i still have no friends in any of my classes and i cry during every presentation so i skip them all and get poor grades.
during highschool i meet a guy online who i start dating long distance, hes grooming me the whole time to send nudes though i didnt want to and when we fight he insults my body and pushing redpill idealogy down my throat. threatens me by repeatedly sending me my address to remind me he could come here. I eventually get the balls to leave.
i get out of highschool and start going to work for the first time, work pushes me to finally get over the worst of my social anxiety and i meet a few people who make me genuinely happy.
i get a crush on a guy at work but he’s emotionally unavailable so i download tinder bc im ready to date. Id never had sex or a boyfriend in person.
At 21 i meet my most recent ex. I am tired of telling this story but its the most harrowing thing ive been through. i thought we had something very beautiful and i was wrong. he left me feeling worse about myself than i have in a long long time.}}

What does the universe want me to do? I work on myself.. but I cant heal if every time i take 2 baby steps im kicked back so far. Is the cycle going to repeat? I struggle to love myself so much that i keep meeting people that abuse me and they keep pushing my progress back so that Im doomed to be hurt again? Am I really fated to never be loved because I cant love myself? Every day that I fail to love myself feels fatal, it feels like a step back on this long road towards a lovinf human relationship. Do i really not deserve one of those because of my brains response to what Ive been through?"

190,I’m killing myself when I’m 30,depression,"I spent the last 4 years of my life waiting for someone who never loved me and I refuse to get over him or begin dating someone else. It’s not that I don’t want to, my brain is physically not allowing me to. I’ve become so depressed and feeling so worthless that I just can’t bear to live anymore. No one will ever love or want me. I’m stupid, I am ugly I am worthless. There’s no point in me working or going to school. THERE IS NO POINT IN ME BEING ALIVE. No amount of therapy, medication has ever helped me. None. I should not be alive right now. There is no use for me here. 

I’m 27 years old and a huge fucking loser. I don’t even know why I let myself talk to other people and embarrass myself. I’m so ugly, so fucking awkward, such a fucking loser. I should just kill myself"
191,"I'm never content and I don't know how to be, it's ruining my life?",depression,"Nothing is ever enough for me. Nothing. I have lived life like this for as long as I could remember. When I was in high school, I hated every moment of it because I was single. My friends weren't funny, helpful, connected, whatever with me enough so I dropped them. I went to college and I wish I was back in high school, because community college was worse. I missed my ex-friends and life in high school. I dropped/fucked up my relationship with my church group because they weren't enough for me either. I ended up missing them, too. I transferred to university, I shook all of that off, made friends, got in a relationship, and had a blast. At the same time, I was still unhappy. I wanted MORE. She gave me everything and I did the same. She saw all my skeletons, my past, present, and future. She became everything. She knew all my thoughts and feelings and I finally, finally had someone to share life with. Ever since I was 14, all I wanted was someone to share life with. I finally had it all. I had friends, a soulmate, and I graduated. My life was finally complete...I had it all...right? No. She wasn't enough for me. My friends weren't enough for me. Now I sit here almost alone. I say almost, because I have my family still...and few friends ish. How can I ever be content? I don't know how. All I know is to ask for more, throw away beautiful people, and cry that I am alone. I shared everything with her. She shared everything with me. How can I get to that level of profound love and still not be happy? I don't know. I don't know and I am scared. I don't know how to be content. I don't know how to stop destroying my life. I don't know how to move forward. I've lived life this way for 9 years now, I don't know how. Please help me."
192,My mother died on Thanksgiving...because I realized how truly emotionally abusive and manipulative she has been to me my entire life.,depression,I hate her so much. She has fucked me up in so many ways. I believed her lies and manipulation my whole life. Its so weird how someone can be dead to you even though they are still alive. I wish I could have had normal parents. I just want to go back to psych ward. or die. i dont really care anymore.
193,"The only reason I feel even remotely okay is because of medication, and it's tiring.",depression,"This is my alternate account just for venting. There's only one other post on it currently. 

Originally I wrote this long page about how I got to where I am, but no one cares. Here's the most basic, short summary I can give you: I've been depressed since \~12 because I don't feel like I belong in my own body or my own brain. Because I was depressed, I did morally atrocious things online when I was \~14. Years later now that I turned 18, I try to finally get my life back on track. Months after I try that, police raid my house due to what I did when I was 14. I try to kill myself because of the shame but end up in a hospital for two weeks, and in-patient psychiatric care for a week after that. I go home and continue therapy completely online, this time on medication. 

My life has never been this low. Six years of being depressed and hating every aspect of myself and only now am I at my lowest point. I still face every single issue I had before, and now I face a legal case that will completely determine if I even have a chance at living a decent life. And from everything I've heard, it sounds like I don't have good chances. I'm sitting here at home with a timebomb strapped to my chest, waiting for it blow up whenever it decides to. And all that I can hope is that no one sees me when I die. 

I haven't cried since I got on this medication, and yet I have all the reason to. I can't even feel sad, but I realize when I should. All I can do is observe the emotions I know I should feel. I can feel happy, but it's not even real. None of what I'm feeling is real. I'm drugged, literally. My emotions aren't genuine. My happiness isn't genuine. And if my happiness isn't genuine, it doesn't matter at all. None of what I'm feeling matters, because I know if I were off of these pills for a second that I'd be right back to how I was feeling months ago. Nothings changed. Nothing has gotten better. I've just been deceived with medication."
195,yay depressionnnn,depression,"hey y’all uh i have a question, does anyone else feel like they wanna constantly not do anything but at the same time feel incredibly guilty when they don’t spend time with family? or when someone doesn’t wanna hang out you feel like ur annoying and clingy and you don’t deserve anything :D"
196,Addicted to self hate,depression,"Why do I enjoy loathing? I feel like ever since I was a child, I’ve had a strange attachment to self-hate. Almost as my own force of individuation, it feeds my identity to the point where I almost require at least some background noise of masochistic angst towards my own confidence to retain any sense of skepticism to my own happiness. I feel trapped but it’s cozy in a weird way. It’s always been familiar. Almost like my chronic depression is the most efficient means for comprehending myself. I sometimes don’t even know if I want to stop this cycle of non-confidence because feeling bad feels better than feeling good most of the time. 

I was wondering if anyone can relate to this feeling of enjoying being genuinely depressed more than being genuinely happy and how you’ve been able to escape it."
197,my family can never leave me alone,depression,i just need a break sometimes ive been good let me be
198,The only thing that is stopping me from killing myself is that my parents will feel sad.,depression,That is literally it. I fucking hate everything.
199,Why my friends think the worst of me?,depression,"It doesn't matter how good I treat them, they always think bad about me. I try to make them happy, support them, listen to their troubles, buy them stuff, but if I make a small mistake; that's it. A small mistake is a grave mistake. At that point, they will finally spill what they think of me. They're good friends too and I appreciate the good things that they have done for me. But if I ever unintentionally do something that they dislike, it's unforgivable to them. They wouldn't give me the benefit of doubts, and will think the worst of me. I don't understand. I overlook many things they did that hurt my feelings. I always try to look at the better sides of them. When I try to explain my side of the story, they call me stubborn and blaming others for my mistake. I try to say: ""I'm not saying it's how I am and I won't change. I'm just trying to explain myself. If that's how you feel, then I will adjust."" But they still aren't happy. This kind of stuff have happened so many times that I feel like there's something wrong with me. I can't be a good friend that deserve love and respect. I don't know how to treat people right. I make too many mistakes. Maybe I would be better off without friends....."
200,I can't take it anymore,depression,"I'm drowning and I'm stressed as hell. I've been feeling like complete shit for the past couple weeks now and I can't handle it anymore. I'm sinking in school, I'm probably gonna have to repeat some classes over the summer, and won't graduate on time; I don't know my plans for out of HS and I'm stressing the fuck out because college deadlines are closing up, and I'm unlikely to go anywhere for the next year and even then, I don't know what I wanna do; I fucking nicked my dads car pulling out of the driveway two days ago and I've felt so shitty and terrible about it ever since; my family just seems frustrated with me and I don't know why and I hate it so much. I feel terrible, I haven't felt this bad in a long time. I've been struggling for so long, and at this point I really do just wanna end it, or fucking at least get admitted somewhere so I don't have to deal with everything all at once anymore. I feel like such a garbage human being, I can't stand it."
201,Cry for help but no one listens,depression,"Do you ever feel like you are sending so many signals that you need help, you’re suicidal, you cant go on. Yet no one listens or takes you seriously? My parents, my husband. They all act like I’m just “sad” and it’ll be okay. I just need to try to be happy and thankful for what I have. It takes a lot for me to ask for help.. I bottle it all up till I’m at my breaking point. And my idea of help from them is just them listening to what I have to say, and they don’t even do that. I’m so lost and alone."
202,I think I am getting close to my breaking point,depression,"I'm unemployed and can't pay rent and live with roommates who are treating this pandemic like it is nothing special and I should want to expose myself to others who are potentially infected.  I owe 3 months back rent now and have zero means of paying for it.    I had a few options for making money but that fell apart.   I have also lied to my roommates about my employment status and what I can pay.  The whole house of cards is going to fall tomorrow.    I thought I could fix this but I wasn't able to and now I will likely be kicked out.

I fucked everything up yet again.

Also I'm not looking for money because money won't fix what is wrong with me.        Also sorry if this doesn't belong here."
204,I feel lost.,depression,"Hey. First of all i don't really know why I'm writing this, I guess I want to be a little more free about  my feelings. 
Okey, lately I've been watching how everyone else around me is full of goals and things that give a purpose to their lives while I'm just here, living day by day, not finding anything I like or want to do. 
I don't want to do shit, everyone is working hard to get what they want, but I, I, don't want anything. 
This was a shitty year for me. School has been hella rough, I failed 7 subjects, it's the first time I fail any subjects and it has to be 7. 
I've been thinking about going to a psychologist, but I have fear I guess, idk if it will work or if I will like it. The bad thing is I kind of like feeling this way, cause I can think things that many people don't. I can find a different meaning to things, shitty meanings, but meanings that could be true or not.
I kind of went off the rails, but I haven't talked to anyone of how I'm feeling and I think I need help. I want to get help, but I keep pushing me back and not saying anything. I don't have a purpose in life yet and idk if I really wanna keep on living, I have the feeling that everything could be so shitty. I'm still young tho and there's a lot to live for. But idk. Maybe I should just look for help before it's too late. 
Going back to before, it really makes me sad to see everyone else with their goals and everything while I'm just like, on another road, not going to the same place as them, they want to be ""big"" and accomplish things and I'm just standing there. 
if u read this, ty."
205,I sleep for 12+ hours a day.,depression,I haven’t gone without at least if 12 hours of sleep a day since April. Every time i need to go away i sleep. I feel like a failure. Sometimes i sleep for 18 hours. I sleep so i don’t have to focus on reality. i don’t know what to do anymore.
206,Am I depressed?,depression,"I'm feeling down and/or angst and/or sadness (lets call this my “down” state) most days. Today is my best feeling day in around a week, yet I am barley feeling “OK”.

What seems to be the smallest stressor (which when considered pragmatically should not even be a stressor) seems to trigger my mood from a what is a constant ""meh"" to the “down” state and often lasts for days at a time. Severity comes in waves throughout the day.

I don’t feel like there is a reason to feel this way. I have a really good job and a stable home life with 2 great (albeit challenging/full on) kids and a great wife. Health is otherwise OK.

Communication with my wife could be better, as I haven’t been able to talk to her about how I feel emotionally. I really struggle to open up to ANYONE. We otherwise treat each other with love and respect. She knows I’m struggling to point, but I don’t think she understand just how badly.

While the “pressure” of my job seems to trigger my “down” state more than anything, in reality it is a very easy-going job, with completely reasonable expectations and more than enough time to complete the work I’m given. Which leads to one of my biggest problems – focus. I really struggle to stay interested and focused on a specific task or project, unless I find it particularly interesting or technically challenging. This has led me to having issues getting through my work load, triggering my “down” state frequently. “Focus” has been a problem for a few years, but especially worse since COVID has me working from home most days.

It’s not just work. Other things seem to trigger me and get me really down. Earlier this year we did some renovations and the small little elements of stress surrounding that caused the same problems. As do some social situation or times where I’m worried about being judged.

The thought of even talking to a doctor about any of this has me jittery.

Some days I feel a bit better than “OK” and convince myself everything is fine and to just keep pushing through it alone. Then it all cycles through again.

I can’t remember a time in the last few years feeling really happy or joyed about anything, apart from a handful of moments lasting a no more than few minutes, usually seeing one of my kids especially happy or hitting a milestone. Things/hobbies that once interest me don’t really excite me anymore. Although that could just be the reality of not having time for those things with a young family.

Sorry this was a bit of a ramble.

Is this just what mid 30’s life is like with a young family or is there something wrong with me? How does one get the courage to seek help?"
207,How to deal with a lack of interest in my relationship during a depressive episode.,depression,"I have a depressive disorder. I am currently experiencing a depressive episode and due to problems with COVID - it has been very difficult to sort a good level of care from my psychiatrist. 

I have been with my boyfriend for two months. He is a lovely guy and I really care about him deeply. Previous to this depressive episode starting we were in a really good place and I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with him. However, since this episode has started - I can’t stand him... everything he does irks me and grates on me. I’m so irritable and even thought he is trying his absolute best to be supportive I feel like I just want to leave. But deep down I know that, in a few weeks or months or however long this lasts, I will regret that and I won’t have my love anymore. 

Does anyone who has had this sort of experience before of having a depressive episode while in a relationship and finding it very hard to maintain the relationship have any advice. Are there any tips or anything really you could suggest for me? I feel really hopeless - in general with my depression but also just simply because he is one of the few truly special people I have in my life and I just can’t deal with him at the moment. 

Sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile."
208,I don't have motivation to look for a job,depression,"I'm COMPLETELY broke. If I would've still had my job at Walmart I could have had $10k saved up by now but it was too much for me. It's really hard finding a job and it takes a very long time. I can't keep applying over and over because there's not a million places to apply to.

I applied at Walmart 2 months ago but I failed the assessment. I don't feel like applying to every where else because you have to have an account just to put in an application and that's the stupidest shit. I really really don't feel like applying to the same places. I don't have the energy for that shit. I have no motivation. And I'm sick and tired of people getting jobs waaaaaaaay easier than me. 

I want to go to college by spring but I probably won't be able to because I have my diploma but my home school teach (my mom) hasn't even started on my transcripts and you need that to make your diploma official, with transcripts my diploma is useless.

I don't know what to do. I want a job and to go to college by spring but it may not happen. I want to go to college by 21 so I can graduate by 25. The only thing I can do right now is try to find a job and keep reminding my mom to do my transcripts."
209,Tired,depression,"Tired

So this is depression. It feels like it’s so much a part of me now, like it’s a part of my personality. But I know that it’s not, because I used to be a much different version of my current self. Vibrant, excited for the future, always planning, a sunflower (as my mom and boyfriend have always called me). I have much to be happy about and thankful for, yet this feeling is suffocating. I feel as though I’m standing at the bottom of pit screaming my lungs out for help, but it’s useless. I’m so tired, I simply don’t want to do this anymore. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. 

I don’t know how much more time I have left, but I don’t think that it’s much."
210,I cant take living in this bubble anymore...please help,depression,"I was born into a pretty reckless family....infact downright crazy, 15 years ive been dealing with yelling. Hitting. Agruments constantly over the smallest things..fights almost every week, the only one who was with me was my older sister and now she has moved out..i cant move in with her, so now im alone with my parents, i secretly had my sisters old phone so i could make friends and now that has been taken away (the one fucking thing keeping me from being lonely) cause my hawk of a damn father takes it from me, cause i forgot it was charging on my desk. He snoops in my room while i sleep, ZERO PRIVACY im 15 fucking years old and this fucking narc doesnt trust me, he watches me almost all the time hes around. And all my mom does and nag, talk about how i dont anything and claims she does nothing wrong...always yelling at me or my dad, i get things taken away for not cleaning my room, WHILE THEIR MAKING ME HELP THEM OUT WITH DOING ALL THKS STUPID SHIT FOR A HOUSE THAT DOESNT NEED IT, not to mention im fucking home schooled, my mom is a litteral karren. I was taken out of school at the age of 6, my mom makes me watch these stupid school videos on youtube and just sits her fat ass on her phone, i dont even know my fucking 8 times tables right, i cant even leave the house unless by some grace of god a realitive comes by, or my fucking sister is around,  i am completely alone and i just cant take it, they claim i dont so anything, im sick and tired of being told i got it so good, cause i dont, if i am ever upset infront of them its a problem and i get my jackass of a dad telling me ""you got a problem"" (in that you wanna fight punk attitude) cause god forbid im ever upset over anything"
211,"I’ve tried to help others all my short life so far and have been told to, when will someone help my sad ass.",depression,"I’m a damn 14 year old who lives in a semi-mentally abusive house with my single mom and annoying baby brother. I’ve been as cheerful and helping as I could be since I gained the ability to not shit myself in my diapers and now I’ve just had a revelation. No one give a single crap about me! In my life time and the life time of all my family and friends no one will ever accomplish anything meaningful! Our lives are worthless when you just think with common f****** sense! screw feelings and “ooh no you got it wrong child! Every life is important in its own way! We all matter and love keeps us together” ITS BULLCRAP. I hate it all, I’m so sorry to us all, humans are a leech on this poor poor planet."
212,Depression,depression,"This has been a horrible night. Been crying. Debating my worth. Not wanting to exist. 

Now I'm so mentally exhausted I have a heache and wanna passout. 

I am ugly, worthless, and I'm constantly reminded of it. 

Maybe I won't wake up!"
213,Coming to Grips with Who I Am,depression,"I’m in a relationship. The first one to even feel remotely good in a long time. I have friends I can turn to and talk to. My family loves me and none of them are awful or cruel. I have a new job I really enjoy. But lately, I’ve felt empty. Completely and utterly drained of anything. It peaked tonight.

I don’t know that I care enough about my relationship to keep it going. I keep trying to convince myself, but I don’t think it’s fair to either of us. We love each other, but I can’t invest. I’ve never been able to. And those friends I should be able to confide in? I’ve realized for every friend I have now I have 5 more I abandoned, who mind you were REALLY good friends. I abandon good people all the time. My family may be generally loving, but there is a lot of yelling, even if it is followed by genuine apologies shortly after. My job is the only thing keeping me afloat that I actively look forward to.

I don’t have goals. Never have. I don’t want anything, except maybe for this to end. To be able to breathe and stop having doubts. To be able to be half the person anyone else I know is. I’m tired. That’s all there is to it. I’m gonna go to sleep tonight, and wake up praying for a miracle that isn’t gonna come. Because solutions require effort, and lord be damned if I’ll ever put forth enough."
214,I dont care about getting better,depression,"For the past few months, my point of view has changed on how I see life. I used to want to get better, last year I started seeing a therapist which helped me alot with ocd and anxiety. Last year I was setting myself up to get better. everything has been ruined. I dont even want to get into detail because I'd be writing all day. 

I've started to realize that I dont even want to get better. Why would I? It seems that treatment for depression is just accepting compromises and settling for the bare minimum. Why would I want to fight for a life where I'm just accepting the scraps I've been given? I just don't care anymore. I plan to kill myself in a year when I'm legally able to buy a gun. I'm too scared to do it otherwise and it's not like i care at this point anyways. I've been depressed since i was in second grade and everything has continuously gotten worse for me. I've tried to get back the care I had for life. I even went back to my therapist after months of quitting (because of not caring) and last time he told me I'll probably never be happy if I don't change my POV, however no one can change it. I gave him my issues and he'd give me compromises, nothing that would get rid of the problem. I'm pretty miserable every day and my anxiety has returned just because whenever I think about where my life is at i freak the fuck out. 

I wanted to know if any of you guys felt the same or if anyone has felt the same and got out of this. I do want to live, this is the only life I'll ever have. I just don't want to live this life and I see no reason to."
215,Ive written my suicide note.,depression,"I wrote it a few minutes ago. I can't even cry because I'm just so numb. Buying this house almost a year ago was so stupid since I dont have plans to be around come tomorrow. 

I'm lost in my own mind and don't have any way to get out of it. I'm drowning."
216,Idk what to do,depression,"I’m 18 currently in community college training to be a mechanic I have adhd and insomnia. I feel like I’m becoming more tired by the day and more depressed as I’m behind in my studying. I feel like I become more unfocused by the day, it’s like being high on weed but without the nice part and just loss of focus. It’s getting so bad I’m starting to struggle to read, its got so bad that sometimes I lose balance and become dizzy, I’m starting to feel like because this I have no future since I won’t be able to be useful. Part of me just wants to die. 

I have no idea if anyone will read this but fuck it."
217,I need a journal so this isn’t on the internet,depression,"Day four of no food , I threw up trying too eat today, I’ve cried so much my face hurts, my body hurts I was hoping today would be a good day idk feel like I’m on repeat at this point never really get any better idk I’m scared"
218,I miss a place that never existed,depression,"I never really had a place to call home. 
I've always dreamt of a warm place, with the people i love, where I can feel peaceful, where i can be myself. 
I really really miss home."
219,Music. Share your music too,depression,"Sometimes I feel like music is the only thing to get me through this and this is for anyone else who feels like this. I listen to music really weird. I could listen to a song on repeat for a whole week then completely forget about it and rediscover it years later. I like finding new artists and I listen to a lot of underground shit. You might find something you like so just take a listen. Also if you have any playlist on Spotify or YouTube feel free to share. I listen to everything.

220,"Just when, I thought I had a handle on it...",depression,"In past posts, I had been venting bout my 93 year old Father-in-law. In recent weeks, I had finally started to get used to his eccentricities.  For example: shutting lights off where, they should be on, leaving lights on where he doesn't need to, leaving water running and, going to bed eventually flooding the kitchen, etc. a few weeks ago, I thought I had gotten used to them because, they didn't bother me much anymore. Well, today, it started all over again. My wife and I purchased a Christmas tree, lights, ornaments, the whole nine yards. All to make, what may well be, his last Christmas. We busted our asses, decorating, he said, he appreciated it and loved how nice the lights looked outside the house. Just as the sun was going down, precisely when, the lights would look amazing, he pulls the plug! I'm sorry, you did what now? Well, nobody is in that part of the house. I nearly lost it. I busted my back and, you shut everything off?? Just to be clear, the previous was said, only in my head. Not directly to him.  There is no rhyme or reason for doing that!! What the actual fuck is the point to our decorating if you're gonna shut it all off just when it looks the best? Look, I get that, he's old school and, his thinking may be stuck in 1950 but, COME ON ALREADY!  Maybe I'm making too much out of this but, I took this as a personal insult! So now, I'm sitting here stewing, trying very hard to calm down. There is nowhere I can escape to that isn't an eight hour road trip away. Besides which, who wants to catch covid-19 anyway? I was feeling so good. I was feeling like I did something nice for the guy and he does this. IDK, maybe I am overreacting. Feel free to tell me what you think. Be well, stay safe, wear masks when, you're out and stay home as much as possible. Peace out my sad brothers and sisters."
221,Today I felt the light at the end of the tunnel....... (not that light!!),depression,"Yeah I felt it. Only briefly before it faded from view. 
But I felt it.  
I hear it all the time, tomorrow will  be better! 
Will it?
Most likely no, but there’s a chance like me you’ll see it, you’ll feel it. 

I went for a walk, I made a healthy lunch, I laughed and I felt love. Today I wasn’t numb.

Yesterday I was cold, I didn’t eat , I cried, I couldn’t feel love.

I’m not saying tomorrow’s going to be that day but it might be. That’s a reason to hold on. Or at least give it another day.... or two."
222,I've lied to my psychiatrist for months and I don't know what to do,depression,"For the first month and a half of lamotrigine, I felt better. So much better.

However for the pas 2 months it's be bad, so very bad. I'm getting constant thoughts of suicide, and it's weird. I've gotten them before but these feel more real and more persuasive. I'm so much more emotionally unstable. I'm not CONSTANTLY depressed like I was but now I'm so prone to these meltdowns. I'm seeing it deep into my life now, and once again, it's becoming a routine.

I've lied to him and told him it's fine for two months. Only every listing minor things like ""a bit emotional but not a lot"" I'm at 150mg, started at 25mg. I was diagnosed with depression but I guess he believes I had a mood disorder. I'm rambling now I'm sorry.

My point is. What do I do. How do I tell him it's not working, I recently got prescribed adderall as well and I don't want him thinking that's the issue because this has been longer than that..

I'm confused.


Edit- I want to thank everyone for the responses. I've never seen such welcoming and sweet people. I'm always scared to talk about things like this in fear of what others will say, thank you from the bottom of my heart."
223,Envious all the time,depression,"I'm again having depressed crisis and one thing that it's making it worse is being envious of everything and everyone. All my friends do anything better than me. And I'm afraid I'm not going to improve my habilities ever. I'm trying to study the best I can but idk if it's worth it.
I need ASAP some therapy and these covid times are tough. I hope it gets better with therapy...."
224,Do I dare...?,depression,"It's almost December. Holidays are all around. Yet right now, I'm not feeling as low and shitty and self-loathing as I have around this time. I don't believe it will last, but do I dare enjoy it and let myself be happy?"
225,i feel completely and totally alone.,depression,"i know a lot of other people who struggle with depression but it feels like all of them have their shit together more than me. i dropped out of school because it was too overwhelming, my room isnt just messy its downright gross with garbage and dirty/moldy plates from months ago all over the floor and i feel like i must have done something wrong, like this must all be my fault, because other people going through the same shit somehow manage to still keep their room relatively clean and go to school or work and i just feel like a total failure, like nobody else has been where i am and if my few friends knew how bad it really is they would all leave. every time i hear people saying nice things about each other and talking about how much they care about each other it makes it a million times worse because nobody says anything like that to me i cant remember the last time i received a genuine compliment i cant remember the last time i felt cared about by anyone im terrified to even talk about my interests or do anything that might bother anyone because i dont want to push away the few people that somehow havent left yet i just feel like theres something wrong with me like i cant pinpoint what it is but im just a fundamentally flawed person.. i dont think any of this makes sense but i just needed to vent sorry"
226,"Well, I'm admitting myself into a hospital tomorrow to seek help. And I'm feeling pretty depressed right now because I'm starting to realize that the day is coming to an end.",depression,"Here it is. The day I've been dreading. I never thought after fighting for 8 years that I would be voluntarily 5150ing myself in order to seek help. 

Truth is. Im in a very dark place, and its hard to talk to my family and friends about it because It's hard to explain something about me to someone when I don't fully understand it myself. On top of the confusion I have with my emotions I have a problem with articulating sentences verbally and I think its caused as I'm an introvert. I sometimes think I have a communication disorder because I can write perfectly fine as I'm sure you've noticed already, Sometimes now becoming more often i have noticed an improvement with my speech, the communication disorder only comes out when im nervous, talking to strangers or people im not fully comfortable around, and when I speak about a topic im not really familiar with.

Back on track. 
I'm not looking forward to it because I'm going in an environment where I'm locked down in an unfamiliar place for possibly 3 days. If that won't flare ones anxiety and depression then I don't know what will.
On the other hand, I am looking forward to it to seek the proper help I need to better my life. 

I'm depressed most of the time, especially at nights.
I would fall into a deep pit of loneliness and pure sadness. If I'm gonna be honest,  I don't know what went wrong and I've been trying hard to figure it out for 3 years now. I often have passive aggressive suicidal thoughts, I don't actually want to kill myself but the thoughts stick around. I wouldn't hurt myself in anyway as I don't actually want to die. I just want to find the old me again. The old happy go lucky kid with a will to do anything again..

But thinking about something such as these suicidal thoughts is mentally draining, It takes hours for me to get out of bed some days. The thing that hurts the most is thinking of the aftermath. My final moments, the pain I will cause to my loved ones, I would end up leaving them with questions they'll never know the answer to, and guilt they'll have to live with for the rest of their lives..

I'm falling apart, I don't recognize myself anymore and nobody recognizes me from the person I once was just a few years ago.. I've lost all motivation to do anything, my life is at a standstill due to me not being productive. I should have graduated this year but I have somewhere around 90 credits left because I've just given up on absolutely everything. I have a car sitting in my moms driveway waiting for me to get a license but I just don't want to do anything about it. I think I might be going through a burnout with life. 

I've lost the joy in everything, I've been subconsciously pushing my friends away to where inhardly talk to them, basically alienating myself from everyone. Everybody has tried helping me, my mom, dad, my dads gf and her family, and many others but I just don't accept it. I push them away too and basically said screw you to everyone without meaning too because I would get angry at them because of stress and depression..they slowly stopped helping less and less because they have been bending over backwards for me only for me not to accept it because I don't know how..

I dont know where to begin. im overwhelmed with confusion, self hatred, and loneliness..I've given up the fight to try and better myself and now let my demons do whatever they want to me and I'll just take it. My mom and dad told me they hadn't given up on me and I believe it, its just that they don't know how to help me anymore because my depression has progression gotten worse throughout the years. 
I have a dying hobby that I once had a lot of fun with.
Most of my model planes are dust collectors. Spending more time in a garage then flying in the air, I walk past some of them all the time and it makes me sad seeing them rotting away because I've lost joy in it as I have no money to fuel it.

I don't believe that the opposite of depression is happiness, instead I think its vitality and vitality is something that i have lost. Everything seems like its too much work to do now.. making food, taking a shower (yes I still shower), getting up in the morning to go do something productive even when I know that it will benefit me, and many other things that I can't think of off the top of my head. Medication helps with the loss of Vitality. I see more good days where I am a little more productive but I never have truly gotten my motivation back, I am not always on my meds though which is something I am going to be working on as I have a really bad memory. I need to start setting alarms.

I think it might be important to note that a few years ago when I was 14. I was taken advantage of by one of my family members by marriage it happened twice and I eventually cut ties with him and waited quite some time to tell someone. During that time I was burying it in the back of my mind and I've kept burying and burying to where I hardly remember what exactly happened. My biggest regret is waiting  to tell someone because when the authorities were finally involved I couldn't provide any evidence but managed to remember just enough of what happened to keep my story the same. By then during that time the family member sold his truck so it couldn't be traced to him and I was dumb enough to delete the messages because I was didn't want it in my life. He got away. 

Everyone who knows agrees that it might be a root of my problems as I have not dealt with it yet as I've only buried it.

I am hoping to go to this place to receive professional help that will hopefully better me but I'm anxious about it. Guess I better start packing comfy clothes and writing down phone numbers on a piece of paper.  I think this is the first post to where I included everything I am going through. Now I just need to dig deeper and fix it.  Thanks for the read."
227,Drunk with sadness,depression,"This difficult to write, but I wanted to get it off my chest. 

I have severe clinical depression and anxiety - I’ve been on different combos of medication since I was 14, nothing working. 

I’m 37, I have no friends, no family, and no caring in my life. I’ve not had any physical contact with another person in 15 years. 

I’m about a 2/10 - im not creepy or disfigured, but I’m morbidly obese, bald and I’m not good looking. I’m not an Incel though, I totally don’t think it’s anyone else’s fault I’m alone. 

People seem to like me, but don’t invite me to spend time together, or accept my invitations.

The solitude is crippling. I listen to comedy podcasts almost on a loop, and the happiness is a distraction from the silence and a window into a happy world. But that window is often a terrible reminder of what I don’t have.

I love dogs, and thought they’d give me comfort, but I couldn’t cope with the anxiety of owning them, and weirdly I found the constant companionship disturbing. I found myself wanting to be alone.

I’m really tired of being awake. I want to fall asleep and not wake up. 

Just wanted to say it “out loud.”"
228,My cynicism is giving me depression,depression,"I sometimes am hopeful, but that is so becoming less and less the case. I used to be extroverted and naive, but once i started getting deeper into problems and how to help others it just became increasingly hopeless. I can’t even secure a future for myself, i don’t know if next month will be the month i will have to move or lose something else I love, how will i even think about starting a family? And all the problems they will face. Getting old seems even more depressing. I’m tired and just think humanity is falling into the gutter, selfies, consumer waste, lack of decency. I feel like one of the tortured people who see it and at the end of the day have to almost lie to myself, that everything could turn out ok. I didn’t used to be like this, I was always able to turn to positivity at the worst of my life. I almost feel like sobriety doesn’t help, and that my thoughts even when i don’t think them plague my life. 

I’m cynical and it’s crossing over to a point where i feel like giving up."
229,I don’t get why I’m depressed.,depression,"I have no reason to be. I am fortunate enough to have both of my parents which love me, a group of friends, in real life and online and a boyfriend which loves me. I have access to an education, I have food, I have money and I am able to access the latest technology if I want it. The thing is, with all of this, I should be happy. But I’m not. I’m not happy, I feel empty inside. I have no motivation for anything, I’m addicted to self harm, I crave it at this point. I think about ending things a lot. I feel guilty. I feel guilty someone like me who has all these things doesn’t feel happy. I am greatful I have them, yes, but I feel so bad for being depressed. I have no reason to be, yet I sit here everyday thinking about how I want to end it all. I don’t understand. Why do I honestly feel like this? I just feel guilty. No major event has happened in my life in order for me to be depressed, so why am I depressed even though I am fortunate to have many things others don’t? The guilt never stops."
230,Too overly nostalgic,depression," I often think about times in the past when I was a lot happier, but it always makes me feel worse. I think of memories with friends that I no longer am well connected with, and they are moving on with their lives and I feel like my life has no direction at all. I try to move on but I feel as though I am constantly reminded of the past and it is holding me back. Does anyone else ever feel like this?"
231,How,depression,"How can I release all that preasure? All that thoughts, all that feelings. Its like prison and I'm the prisoner. I want to scream but I can't. Hope I'll die soon."
232,The issue with depression is it's only logical.,depression,"I want to die. I say it not cause I'm sad but because it's an option like any other. I think of ""suicide"" like a scale and the negatives are too few. I want some pleasure and excitement but I'm not interested in any of the things I have at my disposal. Do I lie. Do I act like I'm happy. Maybe stop acting delusional and hug my family 😂. I hate my family. I hate my friends. The only thing I find value in is myself, tell me what do I do. Honestly I know I won't kill myself because the unknown keeps the scale in check, but I needed to bitch a little."
233,Hopeless,depression,"Turned 26 a couple months ago, watching people from high school and college getting married or having kids or both. Hate my job and what I do. Still live with my parents, who undermine any decision I try to make for myself. Always has to be their way or it’s a fight. When I don’t have work I’ll just sleep the day away and won’t wake up until 1 in the afternoon or sometimes later. Feel sore when I wake up and it just makes me want to roll over and sleep the day away. Feel even lonelier than I usually do. Try to reach out to “friends” but they shy away and change the subject, or just become blunt. I hate myself."
234,Just sick of this,depression,"I used to have severe depressive disorder when I was 17, didn’t go on meds and just slowly learned to live with it and grow up a little. I am 20 now and a junior in college after a few major speed bumps,(suspension, charges etc). Honestly the pandemic was great at first as I made amends with my parents and kind of have a better family dynamic now. I never thought I would feel like this again but I’m so anxious and I feel like I’m drowning, I drink and smoke too much, feel like my friends really dgaf about me, and girls from my past and girls now are rotting my brain. One girl really hurt me and it sucks cause it was part my fault. I’ve reached out to some people but even if it helps I feel guilt for burdening them. I’m really anxious about covid and the health of my friends and family and I’m really just drowning, I know the comments here are gonna focus on my substance abuse but I’m drowning I’m really fucking tired and I’m fucking drowning and don’t know what to do, cause fuck meds and fuck a therapist but I really feel sick and am just so fucking tired, I feel suicidal but i know I can’t do that for the sake of people that love me but I’m fucking losing it going crazy any advice is appreciated thanks"
235,All I think of is being judged and judging people in little things and it's really annoying and weird,depression,"When just walk down the street all I think of is how people see me. For some context I'm a 18 year old male and I think alot about how people see me and how I act and how people see my actions and my motions or my facial expression and think of me as weird or that I'm looking at someone in a weird way.

I don't quite know what I want to accomplish with this post but I just need to get it out to people and need someone that maybe feels the same. Maybe there is someone that can tell me how I can cope with that or how to make it better. I really don't know what else to do"
236,Need motivation / looking for friends / long post sorry,depression,"I am quarantined in Los Angeles, and the experience has been miserable to say the least. At first it was kind of fun, I was going on long distance runs, getting creative, and having the longest break from working I've ever had in my life. I am naturally a very motivated person, always working out, always on the go. My year had started off great. Everything I spent years working my ass off for was finally coming to fruition. Career-wise, fitness wise, life wise in general, I finally felt like opportunities were just pouring in. 

At first it was nice to slow down. Plus we had enough unemployment money at the time to actually pay our bills. Then a lot of my friends moved out of town unfortunately, so I didn't have anyone to go on socially distant runs or walks with. I spent a lot of the summer protesting (safely, with masks, please don't shame), and getting tear gassed and shot for nothing by police. I think the overstimulation and watching horrific things constantly on socials or experiencing them in real time for months on end really traumatized me. Also watching some fellow protestors lose their minds a bit- lose themselves (understandably), and having to process awful news daily. I think the last protest I went to was in September and it was so brutal I can't. 

Unfortunately instagram and other socials were the only real way to share information to keep each other safe. I never posted anything insane but I know people started to look to me for protest coverage and insight. It was hard to see a lot of people watch my stories, know I got tear gassed and not even ask a simple ""Are you okay?"" Or watch people just stay silent in general about everything that was happening. I eventually deleted my instagram and my OCD and depression constantly have me wondering if people thought I lost my mind for speaking out so loudly. The thing is I've always been this person, I've always protested, I've always worked within the community, I just never used socials in this way. I never really used socials much at all. But to some extent- I don't think people understand what a dystopian nightmare LA has become.  

Anyways, this is a bit of a ramble. I am at this point where I am so so depressed. Because of my OCD I wonder if people legitimately think my posts or stories were insane. Which is silly, because I will never regret standing up for what's right. And I also know that having OCD makes me consistently edit and overthink almost everything I put on social media before I do it, but as anyone with OCD knows- logic tends to take the passenger seat to the obsession, because I know I would defend everything I put out there if confronted. 

But moreover, I feel like at this point I have no purpose. I spend so much of my week getting up, working out, maybe going on a walk or a run. Then there will be these days when I can barely move, or I drink a whole bottle of wine and smoke cigarettes. Going from moving so much and always being on the go pre-quarantine-, to not- and drinking more than I normally would- I've gained 15 pounds. I feel horrible about everything. I feel hopeless about the future. I don't have a close family. I didn't get my unemployment last week (which is barely anything anyways). I'm afraid of my car getting repoed and the unbelievable amount of debt I'm going to be in when this is over. I had to stop going to therapy because I couldn't afford it. It just feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. 

I'm new to reddit and I told my brother about getting on it. He suggested this might be a good place to find friends or find a community. I just honestly feel really really alone. Most of my guy friends who are still out here seem to have ulterior motives (i.e. want to get in my pants). My best girl friend moved away and I'm realizing that a lot of the people I considered friends in the first place were really just social acquaintances. Today all I've done is gotten a coffee, showered, and laid on the couch feeling like crying- mostly knowing I can do it because my roommate is out of town. The sun in shining and I know I should get out and go for a run- but I am just so sad. The hardest thing about all of this is I am always the most motivated. I always make things work, I'm always glass half full. But I feel like it's so hard anymore and I can't understand how to get back to that. I reach out to friends often to go on walks or runs on nature trails and it's like pulling teeth to get a response. I wish I had someone, anyone who would do the same for me. 

I have been looking for jobs out of the country, but it's hard to even find the motivation to punch up my resume. I know this whole thing was very rambly, but my mind feels like a mess today. I feel like I just need to know there's others who are feeling this way. Maybe there are people in LA who want to go on a hike or work on something creative together?  I just feel so terribly alone. Which is funny because pre-quarantine I don't think anyone would ever describe me as a loner, unmotivated, or any of the things I am now. Everything just feels very bleak and pointless. Thanks for taking the time to read."
237,"Need support, for supporting my spouse.",depression,"It’s been a good three months of severe depressive episodes with my spouse. This year has been really difficult on the both of us and right when he was to go back to work (September) he was taken to the hospital and has been waiting to get a bypass surgery. So activities have been limited and no exercise. I am currently at my breaking point of all of this. I’ve been feeling so unappreciated for quite some time. I’ve vocalized my feelings and have done my best to be understanding (I’ve dealt with episodes myself). 

He spends no time with me, only talks about wanting to die, really negative self talk, no affection, no verbal appreciation, nothing. I feel completely neglected and I dread coming home anymore. I feel guilty wanting some space (I’d stay at a friends house). I feel unsupportive to him and like I’m abandoning him. Need some comforting words or some advice."
238,I(24F) want to be there for my partner(24M) but I’m struggling with depression,depression,"TW: self harm 


My partner has been in a behavioral hospital for the past four days. They are struggling with OCD that has gotten a lot worse since the pandemic. They aren’t suicidal and they don’t self harm, but there OCD has never been this bad. They can’t eat or sleep they are so anxious. We haven’t actually seen each other in person in a month because they are so afraid of getting sick. While this is somewhat valid since there’s a pandemic, they are taking it to the extreme. They started wearing a mask around their family who they live with, even though none of them are high risk. They tried to get me and their family to wear masks around each other at all times too. They even asked me to quit my business so we could go to his families summer home to isolate until a vaccine comes out. Obviously I can’t quit my job, I have bills to pay and need to feed myself somehow. I have done everything I can to be there for my partner, though there’s only so much I can really do. 

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, and it’s been very bad in the last few months since my business is struggling and I can’t seem to recover. That paired with not being able to see my partner who I’ve been worrying about 24/7 has been rough. I want to be there for them through this hard time in their life, but I’m finding it hard because I’m so emotional right now. My partner is usually the one who is there for me when I am going though a rough patch, but now they have to focus on themselves so Ive lost them as a part of my support system. 

It feels like nothing good has happened is such a long time and things keep getting worse and worse. It’s becoming too much for me to handle. I have a history of self harm, I punch my thighs repeatedly and sometimes my head. Tonight I was triggered by a conversation I had with my partner. I was trying to support them while they were panicking in the hospital, and I became overwhelmed and started venting to them. They didn’t respond to anything I said and I got upset because it felt like they didn’t care. I punched myself repeatedly on my thighs and got extremely close to cutting myself which is something I’ve never done, mostly because I’m squeamish. 

I just don’t know how to deal with all of this anymore. I’m trying my best to get more business, but at this point I’m looking into getting a part time job since I’m not making much progress and I need the money. My partner is hurting and I feel like I’m being a horrible partner to them because I keep making everything about me and my depression instead of putting my problems aside so I can be supportive of them while they are in a behavioral hospital. I know they are struggling and don’t have the time to think about me and my problems, but I keep getting upset anyways when they don’t acknowledge me or my feelings. I almost feel like they would be better off without me in their life, I’m so selfish and negative all the time. I’m just a hindrance to the progress they are trying to make to become better... I feel so guilty."
239,Going through the motions,depression,"I should be happy. I have a new, higher paying job, im not sleeping 15 hour days anymore, im in control so to speak. But i dont feel happy. I always feel empty inside. Today was my day off and i spent it feeling like shit. I cant make meaningful relationships and the ones i had fell apart. Im not a loser financially speaking, but i feel like a social loser. Idk im just blowing off steam..maybe tomorrow will be better"
240,Depressed for no reason,depression,"Lately I’ve been feeling depressed and for no reason whatsoever. Nothing bad happened to me. Life has been good for me lately, yet I feel so empty inside and maybe a little bit lonely. Why do I feel this way"
241,I should be feeling more but im not,depression,"I just found out my wife has been cheating on me. Im usually in a pretty low place without the extra kick in the nuts, so I should be crying or something. But I haven't cried about it or felt anything really. Guess there's some anger and disappointment but mostly just feel bad for our newborn. Having a kid makes me wanna stay but I know I'll regret it. It was bad enough I constantly wish I could go back and change my life but now seems like I'm just a doormat"
242,Starting to experience down phase :/,depression,Haven’t really felt depressed last three weeks. Starting to feel like I do before a depressive episode. I really really don’t want to be depressed rn. Fuck
243,i feel so alone,depression,my girlfriend who was also my best friend broke up with me and a few days later made out with a friend of mine over the course of a few days. all my friends hid it from me and weeks later i now find out. i’m so alone and i don’t trust anyone anymore i have no one to talk to and i have a feeling they’re all ignoring me. i’m trying to space myself from my ex for a week or so until i’m okay enough to have a conversation with her. i’m so tired of being alive and i just want to fizzle out of existence. it’s so hard to get through the day without the image of them together in my head. we dated for 2 years and it was both of our first long term relationships. she knew him for 2 months. how do i get out of this feeling i just wish everything would be normal again but no one is reaching out to me or asking about me i feel like everyone hates me and i wasn’t the one who fucked up.
244,I wish someone fucking understood,depression,"No one understands my struggles. They all think I am a lazy stupid failure when really I would give anything to have a normal teenage life and not be like this. 

I cannot help that my depression leads me to have no motivation to do anything. I am trying the best that I can with my depression but it is never enough for anyone."
245,Connecting with friends/people feels like a chore,depression,"I hate how cranky and irritable I've gotten. The same friends I used to love having around or talking to, now I hate their company. Not just them, anyone and everyone who wants to talk. I get irritated and exhausted because it feels like a chore.  It also makes me feel like a horrible person/friend. I don't know if this will ever go away. I just feel like there's no point."
246,I'm a mess,depression,"I use to live in Colombia with my family, now I live with my mom's best friend here in the united states, in Florida. I have been living here for a year now and all I have done is screwing up my life even more with each day that passes. I am trying to enter a collage but first, i need to present some kind of test, if i fail, i will be sent back to Colombia, I can't, i have a job here and a better future then in Colombia, but as i said before, i keep screwing up things for myself. 

To enter college I need to prove I have been living in the state for a year now (which I have) but for that, I need an ID. But my dumb ass never had the idea of searching for an appointment, now I need to present the test in some days and I'm screwed because I have no ID and I need to study now. If you are asking ""why don't you just book the freaking appointment?"" because is all fool, I waited too much and now I'm late.

All I think about is what to do if they decided to send me back to Colombia, Should I run away?

Should I just end it all? Should I find a roommate ASAP? Should I try to marry a rich old man? 

I'll do anything to stay here, I prefer death than going back to Colombia and disappoint my family even more.  

On days like this, I just want to grab an uber and go away very far, just to get lost and kill myself, so no one can find my body ever."
247,I give up,depression,"My life has been so stressful with school and working full time. Now my gf just broke up with me because of my mistakes. The girl that I love with all my heart slipped away all because I’m an idiot. Why can’t I do anything right? Every relationship I’m in I some how find a way fuck up. Everything I do I somehow find a way to fuck it up. I’m tired of living, I’d rather be dead. I give up"
248,Are most people actually happy?,depression,"I genuinely can't believe it, its so bizarre to me that people are just okay.

Like is everyone not secretly depressed and wants to die like me, I know its probably ""projecting"" but I can't even imagine it being true."
249,I kinda want my life to end.,depression,"I can’t figure out my life, how to be successful, I’m a 28 year old virgin, I’m bi(my family doesn’t know), I feel lonely most of the time, I’m on meds for my depression, and they aren’t working. My parents pay for everything during the pandemic and it makes me feel like a loser. I have nothing going for myself, and I’m up to 440lbs. I’ve tried for 10 years to make a career out of making and selling beats and nothing great has happened yet, I’m just ready to give up. At this point I feel no hope for my future, and I’m tired of trying. No one online and help, tries to help, and doesn’t give a fuck, so I’m tired now. I’ve never attempted to take my own life, but I’ve thought about it a lot over the last year. I want the pain, sadness, heartache, and sadness to end, I just want it to be over. I feel all alone."
250,How to get a diagnosis without seeing a professional? Am I just at a low point?,depression,"For the past.. let's say, 4 years, I've been feeling like garbage. Absolute garbage. I wake up in the morning and just stare up at the ceiling, wondering why the hell my body even bothered waking up. I either eat little to nothing, or eat much more than I should. I have no motivation to do anything. Hell, I went from a straight A student to my average being C's and D's. Gifted burnout, am I right?
My mother has anxiety. She was professionally diagnosed with it after she moved to Canada. She had told me it was from stress of raising me by herself, and her abusive ex boyfriend. (She has had multiple lovers, none has she been engaged to. My biological father abandoned us before we immigrated.) I only found out about this abusive relationship maybe 3 months ago.
My current step-father is a rather calm, chill and relaxed guy. He has done questionable things to me, said odd things— has random depressive episodes that last for weeks.. his anger issues are crazy, he's a liar.
I have a big feeling I have depression. Whether it's mild, severe, I don't know. Anytime I try to bring up my mental health to my mom, she simply tells me it's because of my hormones, or 'cause my period will start soon. She will tell me it's a phase, or im on the internet too much. I'm seeking attention is all that she sees.
When I tell my dad, he simply tells me I'm just a very sensitive person. And honestly he's not wrong, im very sensitive. I get hurt or offended easily.
Or, they both tell me I'm lazy. Thats it.
Is there a way for me to get a test? I want to see why I feel like this. If there's a reason, or if my parents are right. Though, I need a way that makes sure it's accurate, by a professional and that my parents won't find out about. Discreet, in other words.
This goes for the little doubts in my mind that its not just depression— it may be another problem piling up, but I'll focus on the depression part. 
Thanks."
251,Idk,depression,"I need help, but not in the medicinal form
 I dont have a chemical imbalance. Idk if its all the bullshit over the years just skewers the mind or what. But a part of me wants to kust become emotionless and join the army, a part of me wants to die for real, and a part of me just wants to be free (even though i dont know what i mean by that).

 I live a good middle class life, but a toxic one. My family is toxic beyond belief and they seem not to care what i have to say. They know or should know my triggers and yet it seems they do it more often. I know now that i cant for some reason get what i want idk maybe im just a bad person. But i just want to be free AT ALL COSTS."
252,Irreversible?,depression,"For the longest time, I believed that if I just found the right person, I would find my happiness. But now I’m at a point where I believe I can’t be fixed. My depression is too deep. Nothing’s good. And thoughts of ending it all aren’t scary anymore. My trajectory only leads to worse places, so the thought of cutting it short is a huge relief. 

The only thing that makes me uncertain about it is having to think about how the few people I care about would be notified. I do want them to be notified but don’t want them to be traumatized."
253,Found my old self harm blades and suicide note,depression,"I found them last night when I was cleaning my room, they were stuffed down the side of my locker. At first I just stared at them, but I read the note and at the time it didn't phase me, I put them back and continued my day. But when I woke up today I just couldn't cope, old memories flooded back and my self harm urges did as well. It's night right now and I'm trying to sleep, but I know I won't be able to.

I don't have anything else to say, I just wanted to get this out because I have no one to tell."
254,I’ve decided to be an asshole in the hopes someone will kill me,depression,I’ve come to realize that since I can’t kill my self I should just be a dick. Eventually I’ll piss off the wrong person and he’ll help me leave this shit planet. It’ll be funny because they get in trouble and I get what I wanted. But I’m not this person. It hurts me to act this way. But I need to leave. I HAVE to turn off my brain. I really don’t understand why I’m forced to live. I’ll just be a burden to society. Take the $150 in my pocket then toss me in a fire or whatever I DONT CARE. I certainly don’t want to live through the holidays. Please if there’s a god don’t make me have Christmas again. It’s just an excuse for my family to complain about me even more.
255,no true friends what is wrong with me,depression,every phase of life there are some people who hang around and disappear they know me just because of their miserable fate who made me cross their paths no one stay for the whole journey i am all alone no friends to talk to no girlfriend nothing  can't fill the empty void with all the technology
256,Should I be honest to my previously abusive father?,depression,"Hi all, I wish you have a better day than usual. It's yet another thread seeking advice regarding reaching out again, but I can't really see any thread that has similar situations to mine so any advice would be appreciated. Sorry if anything I'm saying is confusing, or offending. I try my best as English secondary speaker. I appreciate your patience. 

Tldr: dad was abusive, now he's a better person and we have a fair relationship. Want to reconcile and request his support as a step for my mental health. Don't know if asking to reflect the past together, is a selfish act.

Background 

I've had chronic depression and anxiety for 12 years now, had three attempts. Since my second attempt I've been hospitalised and formally diagnosed with MDD and MAD around 4 years ago. I am on and off with professional help, but currently I'm keeping with my medication and psychotherapy. 

I have good relationship with my mom, which prevented me from doing the first attempt. She knows about my condition, but not my two little sisters nor my father. I have good relationship with my sisters, but I don't want to burden them with this information and make them feel bad for their big bro. 

My father on other hand, was extremely harsh when I was young. I want to believe that I have forgiven him for making me who I am right now, but still I cannot shake that thought. My feeling say forgive, my thoughts says the past cannot be changed and he was a bad parent. 

We have uhhh, a currently fair relationship. He have changed, even though he still speak like a big mouthed cunt, his action have changed to a better father and even owed his mistakes to me. We have significantly different political view, but we respect each other. His support made me land my dream career which require a lot of financial support. I can genuinely say I love him directly and he said to me back, but in the past he was violent and we had fist fights and shed our blood on each other's. I fought him because I reached a breaking point of being physically abused. Shouted, slapped, whipped, knife directed at me. 

I learned to use my fist and my teeth to defend myself in school learning from him. Even with short stature, it was not courage, but a blood-lust that made looking to fight my bullies every Friday during elementary school (mind you I'm in different country. I seldomly experience any direct consequence). Eventually innocent schoolmates were involved. I always justify that I am defending myself, but at certain point I've become the bully. Growing up I despise that phase and ran to different school for fresh start, but I'm still struggling to get past that even today. A part of my condition is having relational commitment issues, one being of amplified fear of harming anyone that cared about me. 

When my father asked my forgiveness for being abusive, he justified that my grandpa did it to my father too. 

My father is not only a subject of my condition, but I think this is the more relevant point of discussion.

---

Additional information

I have daily suicidal thoughts which circles around my past, and the fear of becoming a harming again. I have my way out ready within my reach. However, I'm always reminded about my little sisters as reason to live. 

I don't have any lasting friends because I have a tendency to burn bridges. I had a group of good friends, which I left because I slipped out about my condition from being *subconscious* drunk. I maintain a facade and don't want others to feel responsible for me. 

I never fought since high school, except from a mutual road rage in my adulthood.. Which shamefully I enjoyed. 

---

Discussion

But in the end, I think I need to be honest to others, I need to accept that I cannot do this by myself. My mental problems emerge from me making own assumptions and conclusion, which frequently led to self destructive reasoning. And I'm thinking if opening up to my father, would be a process of reconciliation (?) 

My mom is pretty adamant that I should not open up to him. It seems that my father also have mental issues, and she doesn't want us to be both unstable. He's working in a job with high suicide rate. 

I just want my inner circle to be unbroken. It's been an arduous and too long of a process. I don't like to blame anyone except myself, but at this point I need to be honest to myself that there are external things that made me like this. My struggle is knowing how to be at peace with that. 

So my questions are: should I be honest to my father about my condition? Should I even tell him that his past parenting contributes to my condition? Would that worsen our relationship? Am I selfish to tell him that? Should I continue keeping my silence and work it out myself? 

Maybe tangent: should I barge in unsolicited to the lives I've harmed, and say my regrets for being a violent child? If you were bullied, would you forgive me if I say that I deserved the constant suffering (karma if you believe so) due to my actions against you? 

Thanks for reading, I really appreciate your time."
257,I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and i dont want to do it,depression,"I just really hate talking about how I feel, and then being asked personal questions and being observed, and possibly crying in front of someone else. That's also why i always end up quitting therapy, i hate it :-("
258,I can't find a job.,depression,"TW//Mention of SH

I worked at Legoland for a 3rd party company until March 16th when we closed indefinitely. I went without a job but was lucky enough to qualify for FL's unemployment and I was fine. 

I started working from home with an insurance company on July 6th and while I was training, I thought that I had found something that I could do for life. Then they let us get on the phones with actual customers and my anxiety and intrusive thoughts kicked into overdrive. I started having frequent anxiety attacks and I was hyperventilating after every rocky call. I sounded fine (according to my managers and my mother who could hear me from the living room) but I couldn't focus and I was constantly going over in break time because I couldn't calm down from my anxiety attack. Then around the beginning of September I started missing work. I would wake up exhausted and once I sat at my desk, the thoughts started. It was getting so bad that I had seriously considered self-harm which at that point I had been clean from for just over a year. I got terminated from that job in October when I couldn't produce a doctor's note diagnosing me with anxiety (I've never been able to afford therapy or a Dr's visit). 

My mother, who has never understood mental illness, took it terribly and eventually it lead to me writing a 4-page long note to her, explaining my depression and anxiety and telling her why it was so hard for me to work there. She tried to understand, but I can tell the bottom line is that I need to grow up and stop letting depression hold me back from getting a job. She still doesn't get it.

End of October I started work as a substitute teacher. I would pick the grade and school and I was totally in control of when and how I worked. I realize now that this was a TERRIBLE idea for me. I feel pathetic saying this but I've only worked ONE day as a substitute teacher. It was a great day, don't get me wrong. But I can't physically make myself do it again. I don't know if anyone understands what I mean by that but it's like all I can tell myself is that it doesn't matter what I do because I'm going to fuck it up eventually just like I always do.

I joke around with my online friends and tell them how depressed I am (omg quirky) but I can't cope and nothing that I did before is helping me anymore. The person I used to call my best friend is slowly distancing herself from me and realized that she thought that I was ""fake"". I found out, thanks to supportive and kind friends, that she was toxic and a bad person for me. 

I haven't made car payments in months. I can't make my car insurance payment from November and I'm lucky enough they let me postpone it another 15 days. But I can't find another job. I apply everywhere and hear nothing back. I'm only 19 so I obviously don't have much experience but I figured since I have a college degree I'd at least have some sort of an upper hand. I graduated from high school and college in 2019. They told me that I'd get a great job with my AA and that it could help me get closer to my bachelor's. But I feel hopeless and I feel like a disappointment. I'm turning 20 in less than 3 days and all I feel like I've wasted my life. I haven't done anything with my education and I can't get out of this stupid pit I'm in. My mother still doesn't understand and she just sees me as lazy and unwilling to try and work. But I can't afford to get out of here and I can't afford to lose my car.

I'm self-destructive and I can't express how much it hurts to go from ""such a smart young lady"" to ""a depressed child"". I feel like the people in my life are only tolerating me until I finally get the hint and just remove myself from their lives. I haven't ranted to them because I'm supposed to be the strong one. I help other people so I don't have to think about myself but I can't do this anymore. I'm 0 days clean. I need therapy or meds or something. I miss being able to distract myself from toxic thoughts and I miss being happy. I feel like such a fuckup. 

I doubt anyone will read this and even if they do I doubt they'll get this far. But if you do, thank you for listening. And also sorry you had to listen. I hope you're doing well and I hope you have people in your life who truly care about you and I hope the rest of 2020 treats you kindly. ♥"
259,Im tired.,depression,"Had a viva a few weeks ago and that was horrible. Had a viva today where if I don't get 40% I fail. I only knew one answer out of 9 or 10. If I fail, I have to write 160 pages Nd do tests again and I'm in my final year so I won't pass my final year. It was so horrible. I was sweating and fidgeting and didn't know much. I fear the worst. And I have another viva tmrw. I don't know what to do. Thinking of killing myself if I fail."
260,The feeling of never be enough,depression,"So I just recently broke up with my abusive and toxic gf and that was the second time that I had one of those relationships. The first told me if I try to break up she will kill herself. The second gave me the feeling of never beeing enough and everything I did was worthless. Now I just ran into this amazing girl and everything seems so nice and amazing. But I cant get rid of the feeling that I'm a monster and that I'm never gonna make her truely happy. I have severe depression and bpd which makes everything harder for me. I really wanna die. I don't want her so be sad, but in my head she will if she stays with me. 
Can some one relate?"
261,I've put some targets this week. i lost the passion to do them right away,depression,"Sometimes i try to put some targets in my week to achieve it to deal with my lack of motivation. Lose everytime i try to.
Idk what to do.
I'm losing my passion for studying and all i want is to eat."
262,I'm digging my own grave.,depression,"I have serious ADHD problems and medications don't work. I sit there and realize I have a problem and I sit down to start it and I am ready to get to work and something tells me I can do it later. I forget about it and don't do it. Bam one problem. I have a mental breakdown and make another problem. Each problem comes with another problem. Like a big chain and each link is a problem. The more chain you have, the heavier it gets and the harder it is to move out of the way. Yet I sit here and do jack shit about it and feel sorry for myself. Nobody feels sorry for me and I know nobody should. I don't want to live but I don't want to die."
263,I hate how my life is predetermined from the start and none of us had any say in it or how it’ll play out. It’s totally random.,depression,"I have shitty teeth, years of trauma, depression, etc all because of my parents, where I went to school, and everything else that shaped the today me. 

And no amount of therapy, pills, or time can heal this. It’s just a big ass scar that keeps reopening that affects my present and future. My life is already played out and I’m just following the footsteps. We all are. I hate it"
264,I feel like a liar.,depression,"Most people see me as one way. Someone who is strong, resilient, and wears a smile, but really, everyday is a dark struggle."
265,Fuck life,depression,"I just wanna fucking die, I have no idea how well ill do at work this week. I fucking hate myself"
266,"Tooo much.... too, too much.",depression,"I have a different account but I switched phones and trying to connect created something new. Now I feel free.

My mom died this month. She was in Hospice in my home. She live with me a few years before she passed. Last year in November she was sick and hospitalized. They intubated her. She was there for about 3 weeks. I thought I lost her. 

She came home but was basically bed ridden for the last year of her life. 

I was mean to her right before she died. She kept moaning and I hadn't slept for weeks and I yelled at her asking her what she needed. I had been hand feeding her and caring for her around the clock alone. Every time I would fall asleep she would call for me or moan loud enough to wake me. I hadn't  slept in days...After that she became silent and didn't or couldn't communicate for almost 3 days before she passed. 

In June I lost my dog who was 17 years old. I rescued him from and abusive home when he was 6 months old. No matter how much love he had, he died never wanting to look you in the eye. He was my 55 pound lap dog and the best animal I ever had. When he was close to the end he could barely stand and I syringe fed him and gave him fluids.

In March I lost my cat who was 10. He threw a blood clot which was something I had never heard of before. He screamed and howled in pain for an hour and died in the car on the way to the emergency vet.

My Grandfather died July 2nd 2018. He was my person. My mother had a breakdown after I was born and at 6 months old I was thrown into his arms and he took care of me. We bonded. So much so that he carried me on his arm so much and so long he tore ligaments and had to have surgery. I clearly recall being 4 and him telling me he couldn't carry me any longer and the fit that transpired. 

I had moved away and had a life but when he became ill I moved 1500 miles back home to care for him. I did it for 4 years while working full time and raising my child. As soon as I started receiving financial aid for caring for him my Aunt swooped in, forced me out and I never saw him again. He died 8 months later. 

My son spoke to him on his birthday a month before he died and he used a key word we had. He said ""Pa is surrounded by all these women, but I'd rather be with you kids. Know papa loves you.""

I am sooo sad and broken. My entire foundation is gone. My son is 18. I know I have to be his rock. His home. But I am so, so, so sad. I don't know how to keep going.

I'm sorry for the rant. But I needed to vent."
267,"Wrote down how I felt, just want someone to be there",depression,"Im depressed, feeling like shit, so fuck it why not write how I feel.
I hate my fucking life, I really do.
I want to die.
I dont want to kill myself because im scared it will hurt, but, I want to be dead.
Everyday I wake up feeling ashamed, disappointed and utterly disgusted by myself, im a horrible human being and if anyone knew the truth about me they'd feel the same way.
Every waking moment I feel as if im on the verge of tears, and the verge of suicide.
Whats the point of living, honestly? 
I have two options, die, get it over with
Or
Live, a sad, pathetic and lonesome life.
People don't understand me, or how I feel nor can I explain it to them.
I was asked by my nan why im so aggressive, she asked me to stop being so serious and stay light hearted, but, its not that easy.
People make it out like it is, that you just have to do it, but I have no will.
Everyday is the same, wake up, masturbate, maybe brush teeth and wash face, read manga about some guy transporting to a different world where he's happy, feel like shit, masturbate, read, play video games, masturbate, eat, masturbate, play games, read manga, masturbate, maybe wash face and brush teeth, read manga, masturbate and sleep. Wow what an amazing life, my brains plagued with the feel of anxiety, the feeling of being easily overpowered, if only life was easy, you know, I would love to get up one day and say ""fuck this! Im gonna fight to be happy, I gonna eat healthy, get new hobbies, stop masturbating and love myself"" maybe one day I'll be transported to an a different world likes those people in the mangas I read, if only it was that simple.
Misery is all I feel apart from emptiness, I could be saying this all because im sad tonight, or I could just be speaking realistically, im sad, alone and tired, so very tired, I can only go so far, im weak, im not strong like other people, maybe (guy) was right, maybe I would amount to nothing, if only I could just move far away where the people I once knew would never come.
I was happy for a short while recently, being told (girl1) had been trying to reach me, it felt like a hand coming out the darkness, we spoke on the phone, she misses me, funny that, those words made me so happy, every time I think I hate her she says such simple shit and I feel like I love her, I cant tell if its admiration, envy or love, ironic I know. I still speak to guy1 and guy2, I miss bestguy a lot, the only friend that would stick up for me, yet, im never there when he needs me, I'm a shitty friend, guy1, guy2, guy3, guy4
No one sticks up for me, they act like they do, maybe they did at one point, but, ironically not when I needed them to, and yet I know if bestguy was there he would smack the shit outta everyone, and yet, I cant even thank him for being my friend, what a pathetic life I live, sitting on my arse writing this shit like im some fucking edgy anime character how pitiful can I get, not that it matters, (support woman) no help either, like talking to someone would help me feel whole, funny.
Im just waffling into a random document, in my head im thinking I wonder what these will think of this, wondering if I should show them, I wonder what reaction they'd give, not that it matters.
My life is going no where and everytime I fall into this pit I let my self sink with the hope one day I won't come back up and ill die a peaceful death.
Do I want to die?
I dont know, but I certainly don't want to live.
All I do is give into my selfish desires, im such a creepy weirdo, using (girl1) for far material because she said she missed me, what the fuck is wrong with me, not that that's the worst thing I've done, its just pitiful to think I'd give so much emotion to someone as if I mean fuckall to them, like I said, im tired, the same mental battle everyday, I always lose, I just want to be happy, like I mean something, maybe I just want pity, maybe I want to feel loved, maybe I want to stop being a control freak, maybe I want to sort out my short fuse, maybe I want a family that makes me feel loved, maybe I want a mother that treats me as a son, maybe I want a dad that taught me how to be a man, maybe a want a girlfriend who will hug and tell me its alright, maybe I want a life that doesn't kick me to the floor and spit on me, maybe i want to stop writing my desires on a phone at 4:37 in the fucking morning and do something that means something, im nearly sixteen and I want to show people I mean something, I dont want to be forgotten but also I want to be a normal sixteen year old, I dont want to have to do my gcses in 2022, I dont want to be alone anymore, I want people to like me, I want to like people and I want to stop being a bitch, i get called sensitive all the time, I get called lanky, I get called a rapist, I get called a nonce, I get called a sex offender, I get called a dog fucker, I get called a spotty nonce for what? Shits and giggles? Yeah funny fucking joke, have I brought this apon myself or some shit? At what point was a joke about me being a rapist funny? 3 fucking years of this shit would drive anyone mad. Every waking breath i take i have to realise this is my life, I dont want this, but I dont have the willpower to change it, im the person the system hates, the poor, unintelligent, annoying, clingy, competitive, untrustworthy, depressed, hopeless leach, I want it all but I dont give, I dont deserve happiness, but I dont deserve the life I've been given, ""play the cards you've been given"" there's no cards to play anymore, the few I had were worthless anyway, you cant play a deck with a player like me, I've given up, everyone's going all in, taking chances, making friends, doing drugs, losing their virginity, but me the lonely little virgin hermit in his little fucking smelly cave is all alone, Im pathetic even my mum makes fun of me for being a virgin, ironically I was 15, actually, I was 14, funny that, everyday the same, being called ugly by some fucking 50 year old troglodyte whos supposed to be my mother, everyone I mean EVERYONE sticks up for her, but no one is there for me, you should treat your mum better, your attitude is so bad, why are you so aggressive, you're such a loser, oh thanks, I'll go fuck myself then shall I, you know its bad when id rather be an orphan in a foster home, ironic that, im lucky that there's a roof over my head and food on the table, but under the same roof there's a poisonous snake, its always there, it won't leave, it treats me like an imposter, yet, im the same kin. I wanna punch a wall, I have so much aggression in my chest its suffocating, my hand smells of cum, my legs hurt from coming to much, my eyes are heavy, my throats dry, my back hurts and im tired, im upset that all of this is me writing, that I'm this pathetic, but Ironically I keep writing spouting the same shit, maybe I am as sensitive as they say I am, I like to believe its because of how I've been treated by people in the past, I like humans, I interact with them, I have ""friends"" - doesn't feel like it, I have ""family"" but I just don't like them at the same time, whats the point anymore, no one would die for me, but, then again why would they, im better of dead as it is, maybe I should call it a night, or keep writing, I could be more lighthearted in the future, I could try lightening up, I said I was gonna stop wanking but look where that got me, I wanna be happy, I dont want people to speak for me anymore, I wanna be heard, I wanna be happy

268,I don’t want to live,depression,"I am 15 years old. This will probably be my last message on Reddit. I feel like I am always alone. My parents even make fun of me for my bad grades. I don’t really have anything to live for as my parents take away my computer and give me impossible tasks I have to do get them back.
Thanks for your time and goodbye."
269,I’ve come to the realisation that I don’t need to be particularly sad mood to be convinced I’d be rather dead,depression,"I know 2 years ago I would need a trigger to have a depressive episode in which I would want to *not live*. Now its like a rational thought. Why choose the hard paths in life when can you be dead. 
I wonder if it’s natural instinct that’s keeping here"

271,told someone,depression,"i just wrote a long letter to my best friend about my depression and it’s the first time i’m telling someone in detail about my struggles and i’m scared that i burdened her but i’m trying to not overthink it and go back and delete the messages anywayyy i’m proud of myself for finally having the strength to do this.

275,(first post) I don't have depression just suicidal,depression,"I don't hate myself, I just hate living. I want to kill myself, but. I always think about how my family will handle this. My brother has actual depression, my family will be heartbroken forever and so many people will blame themselves because of my death. I just hate living this life. All I feel is pain and emptiness. But I'm scared of what happens after death, no one knows what happens after death. And if I commit suicide there is no turning back."
276,Too long to read sorry,depression,"Too long to read sorry

 I am a 20 year old girl living with my parents and 3 siblings and sis in law in Nyc. I am currently a full time student at CUNY and I have always been financially dependent on my father. I was spoiled and treated like a princess durinf my childhood days( they dont know abt the trauma i endured when i was a child i still keep it a secret bc ik my parents will not act rationally)I don't currently work because my parents do not permit me to do so. I do need permission to go outside, they limit me on how long i can be out for, who am i working with, im not allowed to work in fast food or retail, office job is fine as long as i come home before sun sets. Im not allowed to wear the clothes i feel comfortable in even tho they are not anywhere near unmodest. Even in my own house i am expected to dress modestly. (No skin, no tight clothes, not too loose) They limit my means to earn and so I don't have but much saved up. I cannot up and leave my family as they are very susceptible to the backlash they probably will face if I just leave. I can find refuge in fam members houses but i will be found if i go to those places and my parents will force me back home and they will start problems with them. I can remove myself and end up in a domestic violence shelter but i dont want to put myself at risk for covid and im not even escaping any imminent physical harm, but its a likely possibility w them. Im confident i can take care if myself because i take care of my family. I prioritize my fam. Mt oarenrs believe women are infefior to men and must rely on a man. They see my emotional sensitivity as weakness. Every mistake i have made is held on to forever. (Mistakes that are not even mistakes like gettinf a piercing without their permission when i was 19. MY MOM HAS THE SAME PIERCING) my mom is diff from my dad but not really. She was a child bride and the processing of her trauma is evident in her behavior and speech. For example she ignored me for 11 days once bc i went outside to get dinner w some friends. I hadnt been outside in 3 weeks. I was not posing a risk but she was upset bc my dad allowed me to go. The anger is misplaced whatever) Even before the pandemic, I had a normal life of a muslim bengali girl, even better than most daughters that deal with similar situations.but my parents have made the decision to get me married even before I have completed my studies. I have the option to say no, however, I'm also told that I am not allowed to be independent until i am married. Im explicity told im being taken care of till marriage. They will not accept someone that doesnt adhere to their liking, and they like no one. (Seriously)Literally dont like anyone. They srranged my brothers marriage to my first cousin. (Diff story) they wont force me to marry my cousin dw but they will be so particular and they are not happy with anyone elses choices. If i refuse their choice they will feel insulted, they will twist things to make it seem like i am trying to go against their wishes (accuse me of straying from Islam, having a secret bf) they will guilt trip me. It so sad bc i am expected to smile when i see them and look so happy but everytime i see them i want to cry. They dont care about how we feel boo hoo.There are many things I can do , like just leave and depend on myself. Give in and be unhappy. Fight back and see the consequences of my actions. If i go against their wishes, I don't know the consequences. It can be violent as my parents have put their hands on me. (rare) They scream, humiliate, manipulate, gaslight me and my older sibling. They take their anger out on other ppl and we have to let them .They forces us to be dependent on them so if we dont listen to them, we have no means to support ourselves. Yes, my job is to finish my education and look for a job. Work, save your money, and leave. This is what I am trying to accomplish. I dont want to be like them.My mental health has been deteriorating for years and i have been receiving medication and counseling for as a treatment plan however, I still deal with this interpersonal violence and have to continue to endure it till my parents arrange my marriage to someone of their standards. I take antidepressants just to control mt emotions because i would not be able to get out of bes sometimes or focus on anything without crying in between. My main goal to reach the means to support myself and have some slace. I have had job offers that my parents have left me no choice to decline. (he took me out of the country). My parents have found out that i have some money saved up and now they expect me to contribute to household expenses while i dont hold a job. Im not allowed to be independent but im doing things that independent adults are doing for themselves. This makes it hard for me to accumulate money without having a steady income. Though they are not against my education, but they have very less interest in my studies and they have planned my life out for me and I'm to follow. They let me study whatever because they know that i will end up with a man that will support me financially etc. that may sound less awful but i like someone and my parents will never accept him. (This is important but not rn)My older brother who is married and has dealt with this situation but didnt fight back advised me to find someone of my liking (must be Muslim, preferably bengali unless i want to deal with even more drama)and find him soon unless i want to stay and deal with my parents and taking care of children and house responsibilities and remote schooling which they always neglect to give me an environment to study. My sis in laws housework can almost be considered a 9-5 in return she lives as a family member and is provided for. When she has the baby, i know i will be expected to care for the child bc my parents wont allow a break from her responsibilities. ( she has HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDAUM AND MY PARENTS THINK ITS LAZINESS LOL)I schedule take everyone to all their appointments, everyones. All 6 other members of my family. My youngest little brother has FOP disease and its so hard for me to see him be so miserable in his own home. My other little brother has a learning disability that my parents misunderstand for misbehaving and just being immature and lazy. In my own room, its hard to study when i cant even read a paragraph because everyone in the house is screaminf. I have to turn off my camera and mic because ppl will suddenly come in ans out and scream and it could sound very concerning. Its so hard to explain to my professors how much this is taking a toll on me.Idk how to focus when my parents pull me out class or my work to do things for them. Ofc i have tried to set boundaries but they gaslight me into making me feel like i dont do enough for the family. I have been coparenting my mother in raising two young kids since i was 11. Ive been completing all the paperwork that goes on in the house, whethere its expecting to pay bills on time for my father, expecting to help my pregnant sis in law because she doesnt know english. I am fully responsible for my two younger brothers education and health.  Sometime i find them making me help someone else (outside the fam)bc my father promised them i would do this for them, without even asking me. I do most of the communication for my father and im expected to do these. If i dont then i am an ungrateful. That i dont prioritize them. They guilt trip us.  And i have never said no. I dont speak back bc then they will punish me. It quite possibly can get physical but its usually them screaming their lungs out, insulting me, They have me in psychological chains. No, there is not much physical abuse I am to escape them, but everyday gets harder and harder for me to continue. I'm limited in what I can do. I have a physically disabled sibling, another younger sibling, a pregnant sister in law that is also forced to depend of my parents, and my older brother, who is also in the same position but he works with my father. My responsibilities as the daughter is to follow my mother and sis in law in their routine which is fine with me. But they have always tried to keep me inside the house and away from other people, including other family members, friends etc since adolescence . I'm not allowed outside the house for more than an hour a day, even when i have responsibilities. If i am away for even one hour, not a second goes by before they begin to call me phone and demand i leave whatever im doing and come home. If i dont i can expect a period of yelling, stern lecturing, and they restrict me even more. It has been difficult trying to balance school, complete training, trying to find work, taking care of my family fulltime aswell, and maintaining my mental health. Yes, I get there are strategies to deal with these kinds of situations however, I see very little hope in the ability to live an independent life. If i dont follow my parents instructions, i will be left alone and will be left to support myself. This pandemic has heightened all the stress and intensity and leaves me in a sulken depressed state. No amount of medicine or therapy will help me escape this situation. I have to be there for my siblings and my sister in law. The gender based violence may not always be physical, but everyone in my home is miserable. To have our own parents twist our arm till we give in. I am feeling so hurt writing this and i don't know where to go or what to do. If my parents introduce me to a potential suitor(s), i will be expected to choose now or delay until i have finish my studies. Regardless, there is not sign of willingness to allow me, their only daughter, make a decision for myself. Never happened, never will happen under his roof. what can i do? Should i complete my studies and find a job and leave. This will lead them to possibly disowning me. May forbid me to see my family members that rely on my support, maybe not moneywise but theres no one in the house to advocate for my younger siblings that need diff type of attention and environment that they are not receiving. My sis in law has always fallen to being the housewife and is expected to do her daily chores and cook and clean ans maintain the house and the family.  She has never worked and is discouraged from pursuing education and now she is pregnant with no means to support herself and her baby unless its relying on my brother who ultimately also depends on the money my father gives him. I am discouraged from working bc it takes me away from the home and taking care of the family and its not “necessary” since my parsnts provide for me but they dont really care that i have to work, to build my resume, to enhance my education, to financially provide for myself. They say i can work online and i have been having such a hard time finding s remote jobs with the qualifications i have which is not many. I decided i will pay for medical assistant classes so that i can be certified and have some help finding jobs, even so, i dont know if my parents will ultimately work after I completed. They expect me to finish the classes but they are telling me i cant go to work in a hospital. Ofc I understand the risk of bringing home Covid19, but this is what is masking their actual reason is that they dont want me to earn. Women are to take care of the household and they can work if they want to but as long as it doesnt come between her “responsibilities”. This is so maddening. They are not only like this to me and my siblings but everyone in our family including their siblings, their siblings families, cousins etc. everyone is always left quiet bc whenever anyone stands up to my parents, my parents will bash them, humiliate, if they can maybe even slap them. They will always put them in their place which they believe is at their feet. And its sad to say that i will have to continue living like this because i am to follow my religion in this household and my religion tells me that i must obey my parents. Yeah it also says u cant trwat ppl like shit but like i said, my parents will never let someone speak over them about anything. Sorry i dont want to read this over snd skim for mistakes but im grateful for the house i live in, the food i eat, my loving siblings, i love my parents snd they love me. But we will never be on the same page because they don’t respect anyone but expect to be treated like royalty. Im not even asking for advice but i am always labelled as dramatic but this is my life. At the end of the day, no one can detect any resentment from me bc i keep a smile on my face and im obedient to my parents. Lets hope this job search gets a little easier and these essays get written quickly😞"
277,feels like something is wrong with me and idk how to feel,depression,"So I have had a lot of debates on myself when it comes to my mental health and I almost feel like I have no idea where to categorize myself. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but always felt like something was missing. 

I grew up around a lot of chaos, not in my immediate family but with cousins/aunt/uncles. Lost a lot of very dear and influential family members in my childhood and was bullied to the point of self harm in the sixth grade. I was more of an outcast in my early teens, and in high school my parents divorced. 

My dad was never really involved and things took a turn when my mom left and my sister ( who was 22 ) decided to stay living with my dad. Over the course of three years, my dad became mentally abusive, rude, explosive, my sister moved out and I pretty much dropped out of school. We never had food in the house and I ended up telling him one morning that I was leaving, because I had bad suicidal thoughts the night prior. 

My mom and I have worked our asses off but we have struggled a lot the last year and I feel like my mental health has taken a turn and I'm starting to really think about things. 

I have panic attacks weekly, nightmares since I was a kid, sometimes cry/breakdown and have conversations with myself out loud, sometimes almost as if I'm working things out w someone. Speaking in front of people on my own gives me mouth and body twitches and I always feel exhausted. I have really bad mood swings and am really self conscious to the point where most days it consumes me. It feels like my head and thoughts don't stop from the moment I wake up till I fall asleep. I just feel so lost, especially with myself.

Pretty much open to any opinions or insight on this, as my family and doctor have struggled with it and is always considered regular anxiety/depression.

tl;dr looking for insight on my depression/anxiety or any other possible mental illnesses, as I have had a hard time with it being diagnosed/discussing with friends or family"
278,I feel like I’m making up my own sadness,depression,i have never been diagnosed with depression and honestly avoid therapy but i feel constantly like i make up my own sadness. i feel like i’m just “being sad to be sad” and that i can snap out of it at any point. i’ve been pretty down for about a month or two and just can’t figure out if i should actually worry or if i’m just being dramatic. i just don’t feel like i have a right to be sad and i feel guilt for being dramatic about my feelings. does anyone else ever feel this way?
279,I’m 24 and I have no money to turn my life around.,depression,"I’m 24. No degree. Did poorly on my A-levels. Dropped out of uni during 2nd year so I can’t apply for a new subject. No contact with family (they wouldn’t be able to support me anyway). Unemployed. Struggling to find a retail job due to COVID. No career prospects whatsoever. Everyday feels hazy and bleak. I’ve let my depression and anxiety take over my life for years now. I can’t rely on myself to make the right decisions. I don’t know what to do. With no money, there’s literally nothing I can do."

281,I don’t know how to take care of myself anymore,depression,"Hello, this is my first post on Reddit because I just don’t know what to do anymore. For some background on me (21F), I’ve been depressed for 10 years now and I’ve been diagnosed with severe depressive disorder. I started going to therapy this year but it’s just not working. I tried antidepressants but I had an awful reaction that landed me in the ER and I thought I was going to die. Now I’m scared to try antidepressants again. I am now the worst I have ever been. Everything is too much of a burden and I don’t care if I lose everything. I sleep all day and I can’t do anything. I’m not eating and I feel like I’m going to pass out or like I’m “high.” I can’t bring myself to eat or do anything. I don’t think I can bring myself to go to work. I feel like I’m going crazy because usually when I get extremely depressed I hear voices (although I know they’re not real) and it freaks me out. I don’t have a lot of support. The only support I really have is my friend and my brother and they don’t know what to do with me. I lost a lot of friends this year. My mom ignores or denies my mental health even when I try to talk about it. She knows I’ve been in bed for days and doesn’t say anything. For the last month or so I tried to cope by getting high but it just doesn’t work. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m done. I’ve been trying so hard for so long and I don’t want to keep trying anymore. I’m so exhausted. I just don’t know what to do anymore or how to take care of myself. I just don’t want to be here anymore."
282,I need suggestions.,depression,"Ok, I realize that this may not be the best place to post this. But I *am* depressed, and I know there are a ton of active users on this sub. So I'm hoping that someone will see this ASAP and lend me a hand.

Here's the deal. I'm an alcoholic. I've been struggling with alcoholism for years (I'm only 19), but this weekend it has become apparent to me that I'm a literal, actual alcoholic. I blacked out last night and woke up in panic, wondering what I had done the night before. Luckily, I didn't do anything that serious (aside from sending a few embarrassing text messages). But even so, I couldn't even make it 3 hours before my shaky hands and panic attacks became too much. I started drinking at 2PM, which is unfortunately commonplace for me at this point.

Anyway, I have work tomorrow. Obviously I can't be drunk during the day, but my withdrawal symptoms are too intense to ignore. So what do I do? On top of that, I'm broke as fuck so I can't even afford to keep buying more booze. I spent $15 on a mickey today, and that's probably the last I can afford for the next week and a half.

So I'm really fucking worried about what I'm gonna do tomorrow. I also have a freelance side project lined up for this week, and that's gonna be just as big of a problem.

The reason I'm drinking so much these days is because I'm trying to cut down on my weed intake. Can you believe that? I replaced one addiction with a different, more serious one. Unbelievable. But anyway, the point is that I don't think I'll be able to make it through the day without getting uncontrollable anxiety due to withdrawal.

I know there are other depressed, alcoholic fucks on this sub, so I'm asking for your help. How am I supposed to survive the day tomorrow? Not only can I not afford it, but I'm just really scared that I'll do something stupid if I don't ""get my fix"". Maybe I'll borrow more money and add onto the 3k+ mountain of debt that I already have. Maybe I'll steal a bottle from the liquor store and get sent to jail. Maybe I'll rob an innocent old lady for 20 bucks just so I can buy some vodka. Fuck.

How am I supposed to do this? I really don't fucking know how I'm gonna survive tomorrow. I don't *think* I'm gonna kill myself, but who knows, maybe the pain will get so bad that I'll have no other option.

Rehab? Maybe. But I can't afford to take that much time off from work. All I have in this world is my apartment and personal space, and I won't be able to maintain those things if I get fired. I'll have to move back in with my parents, and while they're certainly supportive, that is one of the **last** things I want to do right now.

Just- help. If you have any advice to provide, please do. And for the love of God, don't be like my friends and suggest ""just stop drinking"". It's not that fucking simple. So please. Give me some help."
284,Buying a 🔫 sometime next week,depression,"After today I don't think it could be any clearer to myself that I have absolutely no interest in trying to carry on anymore. I've been starting to losing control over my emotions around home as of late, and while my parents are completely oblivious as to what's really going on in my thoughts. when I'm not a miserable wreck who wastes his time smoking pot and drinking his life away, I'm just an angry ungrateful pest who is just a bother to them. 

The thing I fear more right now is losing control while at work, and while that hasn't happened yet, I'd rather not dilly. I was planning on just purchasing it not with the intent of using it right away or anything, but as a reminder that it's there until I'm ready. Now I think I'll be coming up with a game plan the minute I get home with it."

She just wants to return it, and I feel like I’ve failed her, and myself, and just, a failure in everything.... crying is unstoppable, and it only makes me feel worse.

I feel like I have no one. I’m home from college for break my roommates live in different states , my cousin is in Florida, and I have my aunt her but she would report me to my mom . I’m trying to get away so she doesn’t have control over my money or housing or car or parrot but I have no idea how to get away safely and I’m terrified because she says that I keep being horrible to her but I just want her to leave me alone she keeps saying that I have to go see a therapist and I sleep all day and do nothing I’ve only been back a few days . I’m trying to take care of my mental health at my own pace but she just won’t stop nagging me and wonders why I get upset and she is always trying to give me meds that aren’t prescribed and she gets upset when I say no because she thinks she is helping but I don’t feel comfortable with that.

i don’t like who i’ve become and i still have moments where i feel something so i’m trying to cling to that for now

289,My grandma died...,depression,"My grandma died 11/19/2020 and I found out through facebook. 

There was miscommunication and also my step aunt purposely didn't notify my family.  Only told my dad she went to the hospital at 5:30am that morning but didn't say anything later. 

I continued working that day waiting for an update. I called my dad telling him I'm a mess and I'm worried this is the end. I went to my therapist appointment at 4pm saying the same thing. Also that if it is, I wish I could say goodbye or at least have my dad tell me. I called my dad after at 5pm and no update. We had hope since there was no update still hours later. I was casually scrolling around 6pm. My step aunt made a Facebook post around 5pm.

It was a shitty evening. My grandma died at 11am. I found out through facebook at 6pm. I called my step grandpa and asked why no one called. Told him how I found out. He felt so bad. But I can't get over it. 

My grandma is gone. I'll never get to see her again. I'll never get to call her again. I FOUND OUT SHE DIED THROUGH A FUCKING FACEBOOK POST. I cried so hard that night. I'm still so sad and so angry. I want to let go of that anger because it's not going to bring her back. I'm just so mad how I found out. How do I get over this?? Is that stupid to not want to be angry??"
290,"A shitty depressing thing I made (but all of its true, at least in my eyes)",depression,"We were placed in an Oasis, a place surrounded by death and darkness

We were placed in this beautiful place full of color and life,

and yet, we chose to divide ourselves and our home,

to kill each other and soak the sands in blood.

we slave away to fill the wounds we made with our own two hands,

we hack and slash our way side by side onward, to empty prizes,

and yet, if only we had taken the chances to look at those by our sides,

and explore our oasis together, to fill our wounds with each other,

but no, we live a life of sorrow in a place of wonder.

searching for something truly good in the darkest place.

292,I can’t live with my guilt from being a catfish,depression,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you."
293,just need to vent,depression,"i feel so guilty about everything. mostly about my mom, i treat her like absolute shit even though i realty don’t mean it i just have anger issues and the thing is i can’t apologize to her about the wrong i do because affection is disgusting to me i just can’t bring myself to saying “i’m sorry” it’s like pulling tooth.. my anxiety always gets the best of me which causes me to lash out and say things i really don’t mean but i still feel so guiltily about it even if i don’t mean it. i’m such a shitty person i don’t think i’m EVER going to change i’m gonna be miserable my whole life. i really hate myself"
294,My last 3 hours,depression,"I think at midnight I’m gonna end it. I’m tired of waking up in the morning. I am constantly mentally exhausted and I don’t want to deal with it anymore. I’m fat and can’t find love, while all my family are finding people. Idk, I kind of want someone to talk me out of it but I also just want to do it. But I’m too much of a coward to do it so I also just wish someone would kill men while I slept. Idk. If I do it I just wanted to say goodbye to someone while my family stays sleeping."
295,I don't think medication is helping me,depression,I've been taking medication for my depression for about a year now. It doesn't feel like it's working. I don't see much improvement in my mood. I've been trying to book an appointment with my psychiatrist but she isn't available. How do I know if medication is helping me or not? 
296,I wish I had been successful with my overdose,depression,"In 2016, I intentionally overdosed on trazodone (it's pretty uncommon to die from an overdose of trazodone but I didn't know that at the time, I just took what I had thinking it would kill me). 

My ex's mom found me at my apartment and drove me to the hospital. They did a charcoal treatment and I stayed there for a week. 

Back then, I was grateful that I was able to come out of it okay. But lately all I can think about is how I wish I had done a better job at getting it done. I'm so tired of existing. I just want to give up. I have a 3 year old, who I love so much. But I just can't give him a good life. If I knew without a doubt he would be okay and taken care of by someone loving, I'd leave this world today.

Some people are not made for this world. They're born weak. And suffer through a life they didn't ask for. I'm weak. I'm so tired of pretending I'm not. 

I'm so tired."
297,Feeling really suicidal after my 8 year relationship ended...,depression,"My ex of 8 years left me 2 weeks ago. Day by day the apartment we shared became more empty as she would take her stuff while I’m at work... the pain of seeing her belongings vanish as fast as she did is crippling.... I started having vivid dreams about her... I can’t stop seeing her in the corners of that apartment where she used to fill those spaces with her beauty, her laughter, her voice... I’m just so devastated... I love this woman so much and she left... I can’t even be in that apartment without feeling so much pain... I feel so suicidal as I feel a half of me has gone away... I don’t know how to deal with this pain... she’s moving to another state to take care of her aunt so I know I won’t see her anymore and that kills me so much I just want to help her and be there for her... but she chose to separate... she was my life, she was my plans, my best friend and my soulmate"
298,Feel like I want to hit the restart button on everything,depression,"So many mistakes piling up on one another, with each one everything becomes harder to fix. I want to become a baby again and start everything all over. I don't know how people pick themselves up after failures, I seem to only be able to wallow in it and dig myself deeper into this hole I've dug. It's so exhausting to keep struggling without purpose. How do you motivate yourselves in a slump; thank you for your help"
299,"Anhedonia, fatigue and loneliness are killing me slowly. Does anyone else relate to me? I would appreciate my post to be replied to. Even if it's just saying hi.",depression,"For a few years now I've just been feeling awfully most of the time. I recently got my Dr to prescribe 16 different blood tests but I don't even know if I asked for the right ones. I'm a 28 year old male. I've suffered from depression since highschool but it's gotten worse. I don't know what's happening but I'm getting scared.
I look forward to nothing. On my days off I sit around my house and do chores then browse my phone. At work I do menial tasks then browse the internet all the time. I feel fatigue. Anhedonia. Depression. Anxiety. Malaise. I'm fucked. I look forward to nothing. Absolutely nothing. I only talk to my parents and siblings outside of work.

Guys, I don't know what to do anymore if my doctors haven't helped me. I'm not suicidal but holy hell I'm so miserable and don't want to exist in this misery. I want to be Content and happy."
300,How do I end it,depression,"Hi all. I’ve made the decision to end it. I don’t want anyone trying to convince me otherwise. I just need ideas on how to do it. Something that isn’t too gruesome. Maybe something relating to an OD if possible.

Thanks"
301,blank slate,depression,"i had so much on my mind. So many thoughts, so much overthinking, paranoia, calculations and now... it's all gone. Everything is gone. No ones home."
302,Title,depression,I’ve gone down a dark hole and it’s hard to talk to my therapist about it because we’re online due to covid. It feels so impersonal and fake and like i’m just talking to myself and i hear myself talk and i sound so stupid and like i’m making it all up for attention so i just don’t talk about it when i have her appointments and shit. Don’t get me wrong i’m all for virtual stuff and covid safety it’s just the therapy and lack of personal connection that i’d get sitting in an office is killing me. I relapsed after being clean for 8 months and i don’t think i can even tell her because the mic keeps breaking up and i hear my echo and her dogs barking. Not to mention the fear of my family listening in on me and her talking about it. That is even worse. Because if i did talk about it i’d feel like my parents were pressing their ear again my door listening and drooling over the fact that they get to guilt trip me more and send me back to the hospital. And i can’t sit outside because then the connection gets so weak i can’t hear or say a damn thing without one of us not being able to understand.
303,want someone to beat the shit outta me,depression,"im such a fuck up, i deserve it"
304,"Suicide isn't a choice for me anymore, it's my goal.",depression,"Rn suicide seems like the best possible answer for me rather than continuing to live. Either way, I'm still gonna be in hell."
305,Why does my depression come in episodes?,depression,"I was happy once, just 6 months ago. I had times where I felt sad, I would cry, then I'd be over it quickly. For almost six months now I have been living with severe chronic pain and I have at least one day a week where I completely spiral out of control. I can't stop crying, I think about suicide, and I mourn my old life. I try so hard to pull myself out of it but I can't. These episodes are destroying my life. The days I feel good, I look back and I am actually in disbelief because I don't even feel like the same person. Today is one of those days. I'm overwhelmed by my life. The job, the house, the baby on the way, taking care of my 7 year old and living with pain that doctors can't give me a reason for. I'm in so much emotional pain I just want to die. I just want my old life back. I just want this to go away. Will I ever get better? Am I bipolar? Wtf is this?"
306,"Finally convinced that I need therapy, but I can't get it.",depression,"To be blunt, I'm a black male. My parents did raise me in the suburbs, but inside the house it was all the good bad and ugly of being in a black household. Black parents do not believe in therapy. The only reason my oldest brother got help was because he was diagnosed with schizoeffective disorder and literally killed a human being.

I used to not be depressed, or at least never admit it, and for good reason; that's like a curse word to black parents. The idea that they work as hard as they do to love and raise us only for us to not be mentally sound is an insult, and depression, suicide, anything mental health related is a taboo (ask your black friends). On top of that, the situation with my big brother was a years-long fiasco and my parents are exhausted from the whole ""crazy children"" ordeal. I'm afraid to be honest with them about how not okay I have been.

2020 has been a hellish year. I've done everything from cry my eyes out to lose control of my temper, attempted suicide a few times, the list goes on. I have great days where I think my depression and anxiety are magically cured, and I have really ugly days where I remember that I actually have no will to live anymore.

I've realized that this isn't healthy, and I need to speak to a professional to unpack myself and get better control of my mental health; but therapists cost money that I can't pay out of pocket, and even if my health insurance could cover it, I can't use it without my parents finding out and making a big deal about it.

I just want to talk to someone with a degree that can help me. I read a lot of posts on Twitter about therapy actually working, and it makes me jealous because professional help is a luxury."
307,Why is it so much easier to hate yourself than love yourself?,depression,"I've always struggled with that mentality, but as of late, it seems impossible to appreciate myself.
Don't get me started on the symptoms that spawn from that ( inability to set/achieve goals, believe in the possibility of a relationship, ect). 
To top it off, it seems like my tiny world is imploding with so many unforeseen challenges, and I can't deal with any of it. Overwhelmed doesn't scratch the surface. 
So, in comes the voice that's reasons how much easier things would be to leave this world. Have peace without condition or struggle. To be clear, I have no plan of killing myself, but have been semi-obsessed with the solitude that comes with death. When you encounter what feels like a struggle ( or three) at each turn, it seems only natural to want for something simpler. I also know there are people that are more deserving of these feelings besides myself. I just felt it was time to get things off my chest. Maybe I wouldn't feel so alone. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this."
308,Im done,depression,.  I've had a terrible year with just thing after thing after thing happening to me. And recently it seemed likely streak of bad luck was gonna end. I had this girl I had just started talking to who said she really enjoyed talking to me. And I had a vacation to look forward to. Now I had to cancel the shit because I ain't all to get a passport in time and the girl just stopped talking to me one night and. Ignoring my messaged. Wasn't nothing but nice to her but oh fucking well.  There is so much else that is happened and I would write it down but what the point. I'd rather. Just seem dramatic then to put effort into this
309,I'm tired,depression,"I'm so tired, I wake up day by day. Do the same shit over and over again. I feel so alone and empty. I don't want to go on anymore. I'm not suicidal, but at this point I don't care if I live or die."
310,Is this where I should be?,depression,"Is this an ok place, or can anyone recommend a sub for the spouse of someone dealing with depression. I need to better understand what my husband might be going through and how to better respond to his symptoms. Our marriage is on the rocks.  When his mental health is in better shape, our whole family is better. I don't want to be the woman who leaves instead of standing by him, but some dyas our kids deserve better. How do I help?"
311,Perspective/Thinking too big picture,depression,"i’m a psych major. i do a lot of self reflection and self analysis which is what helped me reframe and understand my depression. however, lately i’ve become more and more depressed by the state of things. I’m struggling financially, struggling emotionally, i watched all the money drain out of my bank account earlier this year and could do nothing about it with no job during covid. i always give cash to homeless people. i try not to despise my friends too much for coming from rich families. the 1% and big corporations steal relentlessly from us. and i can’t do anything about it. i can’t figure out what i want to do with my life because i feel so helpless as one person. how can things ever get better if i have to constantly crawl and fight my way up only to hit a glass ceiling because i’m not a white male. How am i supposed to continue fighting so hard when i’m so tired. it also terrifies me that i may be getting more depressed again. sorry for the rant but i didn’t know where else to go."
312,Im slowly overdosing,depression,"Im on some sort of medication for my heart. I dont even know what its called all i know is its supposed to help stabilize my heart. Im supposed to take 1.5 pills in the morning and at night. i just took like 5 or so i dont even know. I think ill be fine but my head kinda hurts and i dont want to take more but i have the urge to.
EDIT: i tok two more but stopped i dont think im going to take more."
313,Forever Worthless,depression,"You know honestly what’s the point of living??? I try my hardest to feel better and nothing works. I’ve been on Antidepressants, Seen multiple therapist and councilors, nothing helps me anymore. Everything I try to do makes me wanna kill myself. I am entirely useless and worthless.  I matter what I do it doesn’t work. I’ll only be happy if I did . My family couldn’t give a shit about me. Nobody wants me around. I wanna die to be happy. I can’t do anything I feel ultimately worthless. Everybody would be happier if I was dead because then I would be gone and nobody would have to deal with me ever again. I bother everybody. I’ve been diagnosed with depression more than 5 times. Everything I do makes me feel worse I don’t know what to do. My life is nothing but pain and misery I can’t live like this it’s torture I don’t know what else to do. I just wanna die!!!!!!"
314,Coming off of Viibryd- how long does the itchiness last?!?! I’m miserable!!!,depression,"I’m MISERABLE!! I’m finally tapering off of Viibryd because I hated the nearly immediate withdrawal effects if I took my pill late. The horrible itchiness! Like an allergic reaction but antihistamines do nothing! 

As I assumed, tapering off the med has made this withdrawal symptom even worse than when I missed a dose. My scalp, eyes, nose, neck, arms, stomach, legs, feet, hand! EVERYTHING ITCHES!!! 

Has anyone else gone off this med before?? Please, how long will this itching last!!??? Nothing helps!

Edited to add: I was on 40mg and took it for approximately 2 years"
315,I feel numb,depression,Words can't describe how a feel i feel dead i want to put a bullet through my skull before i sink deeper i can't sink deeper i am at my lowest point i feel like life fucked me in particular everything is fucking faling on me one by one i am at my breaking point i can't even feel anything anything when i cut i feel.. Lost
316,I'm tired of living,depression,"There is something seriously wrong with me, My chest constantly feels heavy, it feels like i can't breathe all the time and i get this sick feeling in my stomach. I fucking hate it, it's always here and things just seem to get too much too fast. Life just moves too fast. Everyone around me just seems so carefree and happy, and for some reason, a really selfish part of me thinks i'm the only one with actual issues. I can't get diagnosed yet, but i'm pretty sure i'm depressed, i've lost the motivation for everything, i've lost my appetite completely and i just feel so fucking numb all the time. I like pain though, i used to like snapping a hair tie across my wrist until it was red raw, i also recently starting cutting my wrist, with a  pencil because i don't want major attention but i still wanna that red mark.  it makes me feel better, like i'm proud that i can fucking feel something other than the numbness i feel every day. i do want to die, i contemplate it everyday and I often fantasise about it. I'm irrelvant, my friends don't even realise i'm missing when i go to the bathrooms to self harm, no one sees or notices my scars,  so i've come to think that literally no one would care if i died. I've been strong for too long and i just can't do it anymore."
317,Acting Okay,depression,"I made it all the way to my senior year of college only to completely give up on my thesis and convince myself it was all an elaborate performance that I'd been putting on for years to cover up all the apathy and hopelessness. During college I lost all my friends so now I'm home alone, ruminating on how much of a fuck up I am :)"
318,i don't know,depression,"who am i? why do i exist? what's the fucking point of my existence when I don't exist to society and I can't do anything useful. I can't make anyone happy or proud, I see my online friends fall apart and all I can do is repeat the same words again. it's not their fault for being that way. it's my fault for not being useful enough to help them through. why was I built this way... my heart is just breaking apart. I really wish I was never born. they wouldn't feel this way. I am just a brag to everyone."
319,"I used to be sad I was depressed, now I am just pissed the fuck off.",depression,"I used to be sad when I remembered I was depressed, now it just pisses the fuck outta me. 

Reasons it makes me mad: 

-because I feel I will have to self medicate or be on prescriptions forever 

-because it takes from me the joy and love of life I had as a child 

-because it's like a roommate in my mind I never asked for 

-because not matter how many 'good' days or weeks in a row I have I know that voice that broke me down in my first depressive episode could always come back

-because I am constantly in a fight, a fight to find the motivation to do things, a fight to remind myself I am not worthless, a fight to remind myself that my life in not hopeless

 
-because some days all I wanna do it run as far away from my depression and my problems, but you CANT run away from your own GODDAMN thoughts! 


And most of all because some days it just makes me feel like I am a broken version of what a human should be and it just makes me ask ""why me""."
320,Severe depression with hearing voices,depression,"I'm having a episode of depression again and I'm also having mixed voices, like for example the voices would say I'm no good or they would be totally random it just depends, there a mix of both. I feel so sad and this has been my 5th episode of my severe depression."
321,I’ve lost the desire for the thing that used to matter most to me.,depression,"I’ve struggled with anxiety since childhood and with depression on and off for about 7 years. 

The thing that always kept me going in the past was the joy, love, and comfort that I got from my romantic relationships. Being in a loving relationship and sharing my life with someone special has always been very important to me, ever since I started dating around age 18. It has always been more important to me than money, status, family, or friendships. 

Until now...I have been single since January so almost a year now, and I’ve been depressed the whole time. 2020 world events haven’t helped, but I’d be kidding myself if I blamed my problems on that. The truth is that I’m stuck. I don’t enjoy much anymore beyond the pleasure of eating a nice meal or petting a cat. I don’t have much to look forward to. And I no longer aspire to do anything cool with my life. 

Prior to this year, I never wanted to be single and the old me would be dating right now or at least talking to people on dating apps in hopes of finding someone special. But that process seems extremely unappealing now. I do wish I was in a good relationship but am no longer willing to do anything to make that happen. I’m worried I’ll end up like some of my older relatives who were single the entire time I knew them and they died alone. 

I do want to get better. I’ve had times in my life where I’ve gone months or even years being happy, so I know it’s possible. But seeing a way to get to that point is tough right now. 🖤"
322,I hate living like this.,depression,I hate living everyday and being afraid what tomorrow will bring.. I fear being homeless but it’s bound to happen in 2-3 years anyway.. right now I’m tempted to end everything... I hate it so much and just want all this suffering to end..
323,I can't go over my depression,depression,"Since last year , i cannot stop being sad anxious and depressed i tried LSD and microdosing but no results so far.
I used to be happy.. but now only thing i do is taking wrong decisions and bad ideas ( suicide ).
I never went to a doctor due financial issues.
Some people told me to try ketamine and stuff... And want to know more .. if anyone could help
PS : my first experience on Reddit and first time talking about my issue."
324,How do you stay motivated,depression,How do you stay motivated when depressed?
325,Lament,depression,"I look back at my life. I think that I was always wrong or out of sorts with being human. At least before, I didn’t know it yet. I hadn’t worked it up to the forefront of my mind. Now all I can think is ‘the world broke you before you even had a chance, like the seed that landed in the lake, and not on the field.’ 

You downed as you came and you rot as you go. There is nothing for you but sadness and the quickening of mortality now. Times goes and your cells divide, like so many split ends ready for the chop. You’re fraying apart. You were never even together. You’re a disaster and a joke and the world spins anyway, seemingly as if it means to shake you off entirely. 

My god, this is mean, 

to be breathing, to be thinking."
326,Tired of trying,depression,"25M Had depression and anxiety for almost 20 years. Two failed suicide attempts. Haven't had a job for a year, so not only can I not afford therapy, but I'm also living with my parents who can't stand each other in a completely negative environment. Failing in university with tens of thousands of student loan debt. Back to being overweight since gyms have been shut almost all year. Almost completely socially isolated and haven't made a new friend in 5 years. I don't trust anyone.

There are really no upsides to my life at the moment. The only reason I haven't been repeatedly trying to kill myself is that I don't want to traumatize the kids in the family. Can't really imagine anyone else missing me.

Not really sure what to do. I'm just coasting through life, waiting for more things to go wrong and potentially being pushed over the edge again."
327,"I know my problems, I know what's making me miserable. Do I act on them? NO.",depression,"Whenever there's an opportunity to bond and make new friends, I back the fuck off. Why? They'll reject me because of how they find me weird or different, or that's just what I tell myself and validate my need to keep my walls up. It's a fucking echochamber inside my head because I've got no one near to talk to, someone who can invalidate those. 

I'm not that good in blending in with people, so do I try to get along with them? No. Im a self loathing cynical piece of shit and that cynicism spills off unto other people. That's why I keep to myself most of the time. Nobody fucking wants someone like that. 
I can't even stand my face on pictures because I look like my father and I fucking hated him, my face reminds me of him, fucking asshole. 

2 girls told me last year (on separate occasions) that they like me, what do I do? I back down and told them that they're making a mistake and clearly my mental state is not up for a relationship.

I have managed to talk girls out into NOT liking me, what the fuck. 
I can even manage to talk other people into NOT liking me. I shoot down every goddamn compliment they try to give and wear criticism or negative feedback like a coat of arms. Its fucking stupid. I am fucking stupid.

I shoot down every opportunity that can probably lead to happiness. I overthink situations and decide to throw it away.

Then I'll think of a scenario where something good came out and made me happy, but thats too bad, the opportunity is gone now.

Now I'll post here feeling empty, wanting to die, with the opportunity to live. Fucking idiot, I deserve every waking misery I'm suffering inside my head."
328,Too error is human well I'm sick of fucking erroring,depression,"
And have stopped caring about the side of caution"
329,.,depression,"I have a mom and a dad.

They are around from time to time.

But they don't.

Act like parents.

Their just guardians at best.

I feel like I long for a motherly figure especially.

I have no one to vent to or be comforted when im depressed or sad.

I never felt like I needed a fatherly figure.

I really could never wrap my head around why.

But I just dont.

But either way.

I really just want to cry into someone's arms and feel safe.

Someone to hug me while I calm down and just let go.

I cant even cry anymore.

I havent cried in years.

Why cant I just let myself go in someone arms..

Their soft embrace...

As they calm me and rub my head..."
330,text,depression,i wait hours alone in my my room for just one person to text me and the rare chance someone dose i get so exited then to find out it was nothing important or just a meme or something. no one ask to hang out with me. i look at the pills and wonder will my so called friends finally care?
331,Why,depression,"There is no one here for me. Is there anyone who would willingly talk to me first? It’s like talking to a robot, just programmed phrases with simple responses. Why won’t she talk to me. She avoids me but then talks to me. She is really the only one who treats me like a normal person and I always make it awkward. Why should I stay here if no one even wants me here? I don’t know why I should be here. Why can’t I be happy? Why am I not good looking? Why am I not enough for anyone? I should just kill myself."
332,realized that i was indulging in escapism for the last 6 years of my life,depression,"Upon some reflection and memory digging - i realized that all my childhood i was overly-sensitive and easily hurt. Cried in front of other people on some occasions. And most of the memories I remembered from that time were negative or shameful. I understand that our brains cling more strongly to the negatives, but still.. damn.

And after starting university and moving to another city - i spent all 6 years of university hiding in my room watching youtube and playing games, and now after uni in the job market i continued to do the same, running away from the life and reality of it.

All this time will never come back, i am still ashamed of myself the same way i was when i was 14, i still have the same indulgent obsessions and they only become worse. I did not experience life the way i should have, and my personality did not become stronger and tougher - I just retreated back into my comfort hole.

Be present in life, people, in the current moment. 

I will try to change something in my life, even though I am not sure i will be able to at this point. 25 years spent on the internet, alone, insecure and afraid. I am literally crying rn. What my 14 y.o. self would say if he saw what I \`ve become?!"
333,I shouldn’t feel like this,depression,"I have no reason. I have a great family and great friends. I am on a full athletic scholarship to a division 1 school. I’m never one to pout and am happy glass half full type of person. But I am empty on the inside. No passion or drive and feel so lost. Life feels like it’s happening all around me but I’m not apart of it. I don’t want to play my sport anymore and haven’t for a long time, nobody listens. I hate talking about it because I feel selfish and ungrateful so that’s why I am on here, I just need to tell someone before my brain implodes on itself. I’ve tried to talk to my parents who are both my role models about this but they don’t listen and always  talk around it and make it my fault. They tell me if I don’t continue to play the rest of my life will be a failure. I want to make them proud more than anything. I don’t know what to do. Life just seems to have a half empty outlook as of the last year and a half. I have no drive or passion for anything. I am just existing."
334,"From a ""hopeless case"" to an ""average student"" *My Journey*",depression,"Now, I know no one wants to read any long autobiography so I will explain in brief.  I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 5. Socially isolated by everyone at school. Was called retarded, mentally challenged, creep, ugly ass stupid etc etc throughout my school life. Performed extremely bad in school exams. Always got into fights in school which made me hated more by others. Everyone would say I was a ""hopeless case"" I would probably never graduate and I will always be need to be looked after. \*Think of Christian Weston Chandler\* Depression was crippling.

Fast forward to now. I did graduate school with 92% score. Got into college for Political Science. Graduated from that with a 5.57 out of 8 GPA. Currently a freshman in Law school.

True, I still suffer depression. Have scars that run deep. Have a hard time standing up for myself because of my traumatic past, lest I be hated. Have a hard time trusting people. Have anxiety issues. But I am still working hard everyday to improve myself."
335,So basically,depression,"I've already been having depressive episodes, I have major depressive disorder and bipolar and a bunch of other things and now my boyfriend hasn't texted me in 8 days and my depressive episodes are getting worse and I decided the only way to help is drinking tonight, I don't know anything else to do to cope"
336,How I’m feeling 😔,depression,“I would feel trapped in this life if I didn’t know I could commit suicide at any time.”  - Hunter S. Thompson
337,I have no one that really cares about me.,depression,"They don't care about my day or my feelings and don't even want to help me when I'm feeling total shit, if I talk about myself in a bad way they will agree or just don't answer and I'm tired. I'm tired that no one wants me, that no one really loves me and care about how I feel and even about all the stupid things I have in my mind. I'm tired and I feel like I don't deserve anyone at this point because I'm too much and no one will ever love me."
338,considering inpatient,depression,its getting so bad and im considering inpatient but im really scared. ive never been before and i dont know what go expect. im a 24 F. so id be with women and adults but im still scared.
339,"Lost myself, no idea who I am",depression,"I feel like I’m drowning trying to be everything for everyone else that the small short pieces of time I have for myself I spend in total frustration trying to figure out who I am. I’m not “Sam” (not my real name), I’m so-and-so’s husband, father, neighbor, coworker, etc. There’s no ME anymore, just a hallowed out tool for everyone else’s use.

 I have a thousand interests but no hobbies, I won’t let myself invest the money when I know I’ll just give it up in two weeks. I can’t trust anyone in my life to handle these feelings it’s easier to just vent to total strangers. I feel completely alone in my self loathing, so I don’t initiate contact with anyone because I don’t feel like I’m worth their time; I don’t want to bother them. And my life on paper is great...I’m just miserable feeling like I’m not living, just going through the motions. Then comes the guilt from having these feelings...I absolutely hate that I feel this way, which only makes the depression worse.

I bawled for a solid 20 minutes today, both of my kids asked my why I was crying. I had no idea what to tell them. I should be happy, but I don’t even know what to do with myself."
340,I see no future,depression,"Life has been very difficult the past 3 years. Every time I get my hopes up, they're crushed. I've tried to keep an optimistic view on everything but it's so hard to do so.


I cut off all of my friends and I never feel the need to reach out to them. The only family I have left is my younger sister and she has a lot going on so I don't want to dump my issues on her. My boyfriend is getting tired of me already and I can't hide behind fake smiles anymore. It's too much.


I look around me and I see no end to my suffering. No way out. I'm done fighting. I'm done giving myself false hope. I'm done dreaming.... I've been done for some time now.


I feel ugly and fat and stupid. I am worthless and I've been nothing but a burden to people around me. My parents were right; I should've died a long time ago. 



I tried to take joy in the things I used to love (reading /sudoku / shows) but nothing works anymore. I get mad and frustrated when I hear people laughing or being happy. I want to scream and hit things all the time. But I'm not entitled to do any of that because I own nothing that I can destroy. I slammed the fridge door yesterday and my boyfriend got super angry at me and he's right you know. It's his property.


I don't know what to do or where to go anymore. I just want it all to end and I don't want to feel anymore."
341,I feel like exploding,depression,"Does anyone ever feel like screaming? Every time I've ""exploded"" it's just been me crying for days without telling anyone why. I just want to scream and tell everyone I constantly feel like shit. I want to tell everyone I've been feeling like shit for years. I want to tell everyone that me going through abuse rewired my brain and how I think of everything. I want to say that the reason I don't want to celebrate birthdays is because I think I'm worthless. I want to explain that the reason I'm not like everyone else my age is because I have zero self esteem and because I feel inferior to everyone. I spend every hour of the day comparing myself to everyone. Everytime I look in the mirror im disgusted. I've only ever been completely honest with my therapist about how I feel. My family only knows I have depression and anxiety but they don't know what goes on in my head. I'm extremely damaged and even though they know some things, I always feel like I'm alone. I don't have the courage to tell them."
342,I Am Stuggling,depression,"I'm dealing with lots of thoughts of self harm right now.  I can't  get it out of my head.  It's so hard.  I've been self harming for a long time.  Since I was about thirteen, three years have passed.  I've gone through some trauma, although none that should cause thoughts of this.  I have not been diagnosed with depression, or bipolar disorder, but my doctor has suggested that I get tested to see if I have either one, but my parents are so against it and I feel so hopeless.  Life seems so meaningless and I have a boyfriend and he thinks I'm wonderful and it hurts him when I self harm.  He's been with me for ten months and he has supported me and tried to help me.  Would it be possible for him to get me in to a doctor?  (He's old enough, and I've tried therapy, the only thing my parents think is okay)  I've been in therapy since I started self harming.  It's helped a bit, but it's not enough.  I love therapy because I can connect and talk about things and get answers, but it just doesn't help enough for me to want to stop wanting to die.  I'm sorry if this seems abrupt, but I'm just so confused..."
343,I've figured out the meaning of life (for me at least),depression,Its to be as miserable as possible doing things you really don't want to do that makes everyone else happier.
344,i’m so tired,depression,i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t want to die. i don’t want to live. i don’t know why i’m even alive anymore. i don’t know what makes me smile. what makes me laugh. what makes me cry. i feel dead so dead. everyday just seems so bleak i don’t see anything. i don’t see anything. i’m hurting
345,im at the end of my tether. i dont know what to do anymore and i dont even see the point of trying. I've had enough,depression,"I'm just sitting here now, crying at 1:30am. I have to get up for college at about 8am, and I can't see myself getting some rest anytime soon.

​

The point is i'm sick of it. im sick of feeling like this. I've genuinely had enough.

A lot of kind people have given me help and advice, however this help has gotten me nowhere, even though I know it helps others to overcome their mental issues. Someone please help me. 

my issues:

\- No motivation. Struggle to even get out of bed in the morning.

\- Plenty of things that I want/need to do but just can't be assed.

\- feeling down for absolutely no reason.

\- Intrusive thoughts 

\- General negativity and pessimism for no real reason. I can't think about ANYTHING in a positive way anymore, I only see negatives.

\- Worrying: I worry about upsetting or burdening people with my issues. I worry that nobody cares. I worry that I'm going to make the people that I care about worry over me. I worry that my mental state isn't getting better; which quite frankly, it isnt.

- decline. I used to talk to myself all the time to help process simple things like how my day went as well as anything negative going on in my life. This doesn't help me deal with it anymore and if anything makes it worse, like many of the other techniques that the people of reddit have suggested. (such as journaling).

​

That's an overall summary. Please feel free to ask me questions or give me advice, absolutely anything is very much appreciated. 

​

please. anyone. im at the end of my tether and i just keep declining.

(note) - this is a separate reddit account from my main that I made about a day or two ago. I dont want anyone who knows me irl to know what I'm currently going through so i made this alt that none of them know about."
346,loneliness overwhelms me,depression,loneliness overwhelms me all the time. i have been feeling this way since my best friend got a girlfriend. me and him used to hang out every day and talk everyday now we only hang out maybe once a week and even when we do we just have to see his girlfriend and has me doing nothing and alone for a hour or two. he was the only person i talked to and all i do know is lay in my bed and listen to music. im always the one to start the conversation no one ever makes a effort to talk to it really makes me feel worthless.
347,I don't get it,depression,"Hello. I think that I'm a total failure. I'm hated by my roommates for being strange, I am hated by the people I love because ""you can't change, can't control yourself, you are a liar and an inhuman being"". I'm fucking annoyed by myself and everyday I think about how miserable I am for being such a nuisance for everyone. The people won't even listen to my words. I'm a fucking child, such a fool. And I can't even die properly, because of the debt I have (my parents pay for my education and I should give everything back because I want to)."
348,2020 Pandemic Depression. Help?,depression,"I have been feeling really lonely lately. 

I don't know if it's me, or if it's because of the transitions this year due to the virus, or if it's just because I am lonely. Maybe all of the above, but it's only worsening and I am really doing everything I can to try and help myself. I got a new job, I put in a new school next semester, I just got a new car, and I really have gotten my shit together. But sometimes I am lonely, and I do drugs. I smoke weed every day. I know I'm probably making things worse but it's just so hard sometimes. 

Does anyone have any advice on things to brighten up life a little bit during these times? I feel like I have tried everything. I don't know what to do."
349,Tips for overthinking,depression,"I think this is my issue, I overthink everything. How I look to others, trying to think of a conversation before it even happens, feeling lost in this modern world. Does anyone have any tips for this issue?"
350,I feel so trapped in a mentally abusive relationship,depression,"I’m an 18 year old guy who has been struggling with depression for about a year now. I’ve been in 2 relationships and both of them caused mental strain on me. The first one was a short relationship but it fucked me up and may have been ground zero for my depression. The second one I’m still in.

I’ve been dating this girl for 8 months. I fell in love with her, but about a month ago I fell out of love. She is mean and nasty to anyone who is not me. I consider myself a kind person and it hurts hearing her wish death on her friends because they can go out while she is stuck inside. I’ve brought it up to her and she promises she is going to try to control her anger issues.

The thing is nothing ever changes. We’ve argued before, but I always let her win. About a month ago I decided I was gonna continue arguing and really spill my feelings and long story short she really said some mean things to me and then when she was feeling better she said she doesn’t mean them.

She knows I suffer from depression. I cry almost every day wishing I never meant this girl because I don’t want to break up with her because she said she would kill herself if I did. Her mean attitude also caused her to lose all her friends. And I know it would devestate her if I left.

She has said hundreds of more things to me that get to my head and I can’t stand it no more. She’s gonna be the death of me I know it.

I just wanted to vent I’m sorry if this post has no purpose I just needed to get it off my chest."
351,Ducko,depression,"For all the people suffering out there:   
Have this Ducko. His name is Ducko and he likes green.   
He says ""Quack!"". You do not understand him but he does. He listens to you, to all you have to say, never interrupting. And, even when you don't know how to say it, even when you're not sure what the problem itself is, he understands. He undertsands all the pain inside, all the pain locked up, too vague to be heard. He comforts you even when you're at your selfish-est. But he also lets you cry when you need to. He doesn't tuck away the pain under the carpet of a fake smile with insincere compliments. He doesn't make you feel ungrateful. He's a kind-hearted Ducko with, of course, a few imperfections just like all the Duckoes in the world. He doesn't hide them, he doesn't escape behind curtains of shame. He tries improving. And he makes you do it too.  
Pat the Ducko."
352,Relatable/encouraging/helpful blogs for chronic severe depression?,depression,"I want to find blogs or youtube channels to relate to and get ideas for realistic self care when you have severe chronic depression. I look it up online and it's a bunch of things where anyone with severe chronic depression can tell you those aren't going to work, and it's often in list form, which feels impersonal. I'd love to read people's journeys and how they cope with their worst days, the kind of days where you contemplate getting a bottle to pee into because you can't get out of bed. I just need hope that people do find ways to survive and thrive through the awfulness and to know I'm not alone or uniquely bad at life and hopefully get some ideas along the way. Books work too, I liked ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" and ""That's Not a Feeling"" but blogs/videos would be easier. Heck, even a good comic would be nice.

Does anyone know of any?"
353,"ACE including temporary PTSD and depression. Note: fuck off if all your going to do is hate, im being real here.",depression,"Just about a year ago i lost my sole carer, my father Dino.
In this year i have robbed, fought, addicted and so much more that i cant say on socails.
But nonetheless this post is simply to see if anyone actually cares, my friends didnt speak to me after what i saw, neither reach out or try to comfort me. 
Only when i had something they wanted.
In the past 6 months i have been referred to 2 different suicide prevention lines in an effort to stop the head-fuckery that goes on inside.
Once i realised that doesnt work, i moved to meds/drugs which do work... not for long though and makes it worse tenfold after running out.
This is the first time ive been on reddit, and i think all im asking for is some sort of mental stimulation to stop me from resorting to shite mates, careless family and destructive drugs.
Thank you for your patience and time."
354,Is it over yet?,depression,"Anyone else feel that life is just overrated? I’ve tried making the best of it, and it’s exhausting. I’m not suicidal but can’t wait for it to be over.  I’m tired of having to recover from  disappointment after disappointment. Life is just blah."
355,I almost can take it anymore,depression,"Graduate student depression on thesis writing. I lost all interest and keep push the last stage of university. Bad performance and no one can help. I don't know why? I was a high performance student but now not. I have less hope to complete this graduate degree.

I don't know how to say. No one can help me. I can't take more than a week from now if the situation is still the same or worst than this. Dateline is approach and I have done my best. First draft done but it is not enough. I have less hope.

I just want to throw everything away into water.

I don't know why I struggle with this. I don't any clue.

I don't know what I want and what is my plan."
356,What do I do if a friend is too depressed to hang out with me?,depression,One of my friends doesn't wanna hang with me or anyone else because they're too depressed to get out of bed and I'm feeling bummed because they're a new friend of mine and I've been wanting to make new friends but have had the worst luck. I feel like isolating themselves is only gonna make them feel worse but I don't wanna force them to hang.
357,I'll never be happy,depression,"I'm tired of trying. I've spent my whole life changing my situation, be it moving country, finding a spouse and marrying, having two lovely small children, moving out of a miserable dark apartment into a spacious well lit house with a garden, finally having the support of the gov with universal credit (that's welfare for the American redditors), having a job on the road with decent pay, enough switch games to occupy me for 2000 hours, Netflix, bandcamp....

Nothing makes me happy.

I can't see anything but a dark abyss, a bottomless pit of nothing, and always wondering what the point of it all is.

Life earning money for billions of people for my generation is hard enough. How the hell will my kids cope, even have a chance of success when 1% of the people alive hold all the cards, all the money, the influence and power... They have next to no hope.

And I feel chained, a prisoner of my own life, because I cannot accept my family being burdened for the rest of their lives having a dead husband and father to suicide..

So I have to keep going, putting on a fake smile, fake laughs, fake personality, forever, until I drop, just for them.

I so wish I could just die. Every night I go to sleep overdosing my anti depressants in the hope I won't wake up. I've even forged my prescription to show an insane dosage even tho it isn't that, to make them believe it was negligence of the NHS and a tragic accident.

I just want out. This world is shit. Fucking shit. We are a disgusting species and I am ashamed I was born out of my vile mother's cunt as a human.

Well that's that. Break over. Back to work."
358,why do l feel depressed after watching a movie even after a while,depression,"this movie was called ""lost in translation"" l do not watch movies in general. but l decided to watch this because of some other reasons. but yes l was vary vary into it. l dont think l cried. but it was so real and vary relatable. l think this is a movie of real life. the things l saw where things that are vary normal. like they happen to everyone. and watching it that way really impacted me. so much that when l finished the movie. before finishing. l knew that feeling of emptiness  was coming. when it ended. it gave me a lot of realizations. and l think it made me realize l wanna do acting as well. but it brought a vary overwhelming feeling and huge nostalgia burst through. l started to have a panic attack that pretty much lasted  for the rest of the day but got better overtime. (8 hours or  something) and even now after. l was so confused. how can a movie flip my whole life in one hour. l started rethinking everything and yestrday l cried my soul out lol. its just vary strange to me. but also. why do l feel litterly deppressed. like l just watched a movie. and it feels like my prespective on everything changed. l think different l feel different. priorities. its just so strange"
359,Idk if this is the right place to post this...,depression,"I am having an identity crisis that is making me very depressed. My family is from a Latin American country and my whole life I always felt alienated because I don’t really look like anyone in my family. I get told by some people that I look black or mixed, which is not a bad thing at all, especially since we have family members that are the same. However, I just sometimes feel alienated because I am the only one in my immediately family that looks like this. I don’t really look like my dad or my mom and because of that I’ve always felt left out my whole life. It feels weird because I get told I look a certain way and for a long time I never paid attention to it and now I do and it makes me feel like I don’t know my own face. I get told all the time that I’m good looking, and have never had an issue with girls, but I feel this crisis in identity that makes is hard for me to function. I have spent the last two weeks holed up simply because it’s hard for me to feel like myself. Has anyone else gone through this or something similar?"
361,Goodnight...,depression,"I guess I want to say goodnight to everyone here. I don't usually go to bed at 3 am. 3 am is really late for me actually. I'm surprised I'm even awake this late. Or rather this early. But, I know some of you all are probably up and probably on here scrolling instead of snoozing.

It has been a long long day. I just spent 4 hours straight writing my morning down in 8 pages of non fictuitous creativity. (No WAY am I devoting time into homework more than my own pained emotional expression lol.)

My work is done now. I just wanted to say goodnight. I'm probably not the only one that feels utterly alone in the dark right now, surrounded by blankets and maybe a tv screen. So, I guess, goodnight to you. I hope you sleep well, and without incident or anything. Please think of something nice. Cry if you need to. Thank you for reading. I appreciate you. Goodnight to you, a sincere goodnight to you."
362,Life sucks,depression,"18F when i was little 4ish i was molested and physically tortured by an older family member. im not going into anymore detail then that. but 
there was penetration and it happened almost daily for 5 years. 

i told my parents last year about it and they kicked me to the curb because i was a ""liar"" apparently.

life sucks rn but thankfully its getting better. heres looking to next year!

happy holidays everyone!"
363,Family makes me feel lonely,depression,"I realized I really rather be alone even though I feel terribly lonely. Having my family and friends only make me feel more lonely since no one really understands and busy with their own life and problems. I can't turn to anyone because they need help themselves! It's a very toxic messed up environment I'm living in. Whenever I'm too depressed to help myself, there is literally no one can help me. I hope one month later things will be better. Saty strong all."
364,Survive just one more day,depression,I’ve seen a lot of posts on here about people surviving one more day and to anyone and everyone who see this posts which probably won’t be a lot but I hope who does see this understand that this random stranger (me) is so fucking proud of each and every single on of your for being here and pushing through just one more day that’s all it takes is just one more day keep pushing keep your head high you got this and remember no one and I mean NO ONE has the strength to do what you do they dont have the strength to go one more day dealing with what you deal with
365,I made it through the night,depression,"Last night I had a low I haven’t ever experienced before. I couldn’t stop crying but I got hungry. I pulled out a container my mom sent me home with, and sat on the kitchen floor eating cold turkey. I didn’t have the energy to move to the table. I didn’t have the energy to warm up my meal. I just sat on my kitchen floor, eating and crying. 

I thought about sleeping there and then mustered enough energy to move to my bed.

It was a bad evening. But I can’t wait to tell my therapist about it and work through it. 

Growth isn’t linear. Grief comes in waves, so I’m learning to surf. 

I have been on this mental health journey since I was eight years old. Twenty years later, I don’t have much to show for it - except I’m still here. And I’ll continue to beat my demons down like a kid playing Whack-A-Mole at an arcade. 

Every day I will push. Every day I will try. 
And every day, even if I take my meals on the kitchen floor, I’ll succeed."
366,Just keep swimming..,depression,"I can't tell you how many urges a day I get to want to kill myself and how many times it takes me to revert back out of that mindset, it's like I have a second personality playing with my emotions telling me to drive into the median at 90 miles an hour, it's the other side of me that's like ""why not just do these things that could easily or slowly kill me?"" 

I have a self destructive, shitty, angry, selfish side of me that's always at tugs with who I am becoming these days, the old me vs the new me.

I don't know whether or not to keep pushing forward, because these little steps back seem so small to everyone else but meanwhile I'm drowning on the inside. 

I feel absolutely useless &amp; I know that in times like this I need to listen to my own advice that I spread so often but it's like I repress literally everything when it comes to myself. 

I know that I wanna be happy. I know that I wanna be okay, I'm tired of playing chess with my mental health because it's driving me insane. 

I'm losing a piece of myself, to myself &amp; I don't have a better way to describe it."
367,I kinda hope I don’t wake up tomorrow.,depression,"My life has been feeling rather meaningless lately. I’ve been busy with studying for finals, and since they’re in rather difficult classes I’ve been very stressed out. Doesn’t help that my mom and my sister are moving away very soon and that’s another stressor in my life. It’s weird that I’m feeling unhappy about it because I don’t even have the best relationship with them, but I wish they’d stay. I’ve also been feeling extra isolated lately because I haven’t been able to see my friends (I went back home for the holidays and I’ve been living at my parents’ house for now). They haven’t been talking to me lately, I feel like I always have to reach out to them to hear from them. But recently I’m more often left on read/delivered rather than actually hearing back from them. I know they have their own lives and all, but I can’t help but feel extra lonely, especially since I don’t have any friends in my hometown I could potentially spend time with. I’m not allowed to leave the house unless I absolutely need to, and even if I am, I’m only allowed to go to the store to pick up things I absolutely need. I feel trapped and I just feel like life isn’t worth living."
368,Im never getting out of this shithole,depression,"I live in a shithole with some fckers. I am bound to stay here bc i cant learn anything tought in school bc i dropped out and lost everything. I dont want to interact with these fckers and i want to study at the academic level. What i need is to be around people with a high level of insight and potential romantic relationships. I can barely communicate with people but bc of my intelligence i dont want to deal with fckers that spew out words without coherence. I lost so many braincells from these fckers and im already 26 now, everything is infinitesimally harder now. A depression or anxiety can fck your life up with no chance of recovery. You’re too old, you can never change the way your thinking at this age.. whatever. Like learning is something you do between 18-24.. if you want a good job you have to do everything right, you have no second chances. You end up in the society where these fckers live also where you have no ties anymore to university so you’re really fcked living with fckers. All those other people in university are faring well bc of pure luck that they didnt have social issues. If you have problems you can never escape them. You’re fcked for life. The system doesnt support the weakest. I feel so pretentious to have even been in university bc apparently i have pretended my way to college and the real truth is now revealed and im not smart or worth anything. Its all about immediate success when you’re young, depression and anxiety is massive in young people, we’re literally dying. There’s no long term plan. I would say i have generalized anxiety disorder, bc i worry a lot about things.. and often i feel depressed and want to die. But im pretty sure i am smart enough to go to college and there’s no reason i should be living here in some dump shitting myself everyday. I can literally not even stand people, i have literally no coping mechanism. I feel like a failure and i remember everything people say and do. How do i ever achieve anything.. i blown my chances"
369,I feel like i lost,depression,"Good night to everyone, i am 22 year-old university student. I am under treatment for depression and ADHD with prozac and concerta. I was able to deal with all the disappointments i felt until today. But now, i do not feel attached to anything in my life. Because of the social distancing and all the quarantine processes, i faced with all my real feelings and anxieties again since there is no way to stay away from my consciousness in these days. I need your help and advices to calm down a bit. Thanks in advance"
370,i dont know,depression,"I cant find one peaceful box in my life. a lot of the boxes dont even seem real when i think of them or whats inside. sometimes i do look inside and it feels like im back, other times i look and it seems like it was all one bad dream that never happened, just the slight memories and feelings carried over. i stack up all the boxes and sometimes cant leave my house, sometimes theyre all open with shit everywhere and i cant even think of where to look or walk next. sometimes boxes fall over out of nowhere and all the memories flood the room. i have a box for my mother, i have boxes of my relationships i ruined, i have a box for every man who assaulted me. i have boxes for myself too, a box for when i overdosed in 2015, i have a box of xanax binges, and i have boxes for every emotion i’ve felt. i have a box for every person i’ve ever loved, platonic or not. theres ER boxes, rehab boxes, psych hospital boxes, suicide boxes. some boxes are more special, these usually have specific names on them. i wish i could open every box and organize them, or even get rid of some. i wish some of the people a few boxes are named after would help me organize the box with them. its tiring to carry them around with me, when i leave the house without them, they usually follow and eventually catch up with me. sometimes i can escape them for the day, but they’re codependent on me just as i am of them."
371,how do i ask for help,depression,i need help but i have no idea how to go to my parents or anyone for the help. i just don’t want to kill my self
372,No energy as I listen to the rain,depression,It always happens this time of year that low feeling when I am reminded I have no family and depression creeps into my soul that much closer. I recently listened to some poetry by Halsey and a line in it said sitting in filth the shower too far away. I am at that stage fat bloated rotting decaying in my flesh. Opening the curtains required effort breathing requires acknowledgement I am here in this moment alone paralysed by the burden of having to exist so others feel no guilt
373,Hopeless,depression,"Honestly I feel like there is no hope left. I’ve been taking care of my body, doing my work, getting my grades up, taking my meds, doing everything everyone told me to do. 

But I’m still not better. I’m still anxious and sad. Am I just not meant to get better? And if that’s it then why continue? What’s the point in living if you don’t even want to be alive?"
374,"TFW you accomplish so much in the day and think you are okay but then go to bed and the bad feeling sets in, just like every other night",depression,"This counts for my update btw. Anyways I love getting through the day and almost feeling invincible. Even just doing small things. You should be going to bed feeling content with the day. But just like always, the dreadful feeling in my stomach is there like I am missing something and nothing will ever be okay. It's all I can think about till I fall asleep. Then we do it again tomorrow."
375,LSD and OCD/Depression,depression,"Hey guys, does anyone know how LSD impacts diagnosed OCD? I've tripped like 10 times, all of them were the best times of my life, , but recently I got diagnosed with OCD and I'm under treatment and unsure if it would be safe to comeback to psychedelic in a year or 2, if I can get a bit better (despite there not being a cure). 


I'm afraid of getting psychotic or squizophrenia with the trips because of the OCD since it's a neurotic disease, but there's the question in the medical field if it should turn into psychosis


Will I fry my brain and go into psychosis if I keep take it? I have a deep fear of going mad. Can acid cause that to ocd suffers?"
376,I did all the things,depression,"I stopped using drugs, I went back to school. I graduated. I came out to myself and publically. I got a new job, a nice new apartment. 

And I am desperately alone. I have no friends. I spend my days in isolation, until I go to work, and then right back. 

I tried to kill myself in April but I didn't take enough. I'm ready to try again."
377,Trying D&amp;D and failing before even starting,depression,"I gave D&amp;D a shot as I heard it was cathartic for dealing with anxiety or depression. I got a mixed batch of comments when I revealed my first DnD character creation. One guy said it was cringey and they actually play DnD so it hurt to hear that from them. I feel like they might be a sh\*tty person, but I also am frustrated with myself for why I would want to play the particular character I chose and why I wouldn’t want to be a “normal” playable DnD character like a dwarf or hobbit or human? I've seen guys play female goblins and female mixed dragon characters, women play hairy dwarf characters. I've seen Matt Mercer play every sentient being under the sun, a pirate turtle, everything. I feel like the game is pointless if people reject your character/are only selectively inclusive. I also just feel really depressed and discouraged generally and like I will have to stay in my box and never come back out. "
378,What do I need to do to be apart of the world more?,depression,"I've been through a lot and have issues, but I sort of am at the point (I'm only 23, but I've lived some intense and crazy shit) where I think to myself, why, I might as well do nothing. So I do that. But I want to stop caring, get over it, and go out and live. But I don't even know how to talk to people. I can give people too much and let them take advantage of me. I know when it's happening, it doesn't bother me so I let em, but doing that just makes the person write you off. 

How to human?"
379,Tired of not feeling anything.,depression,"For starters, I'm not that different from anyone else. I'm another teenager who spends too much time on his computer.

For as long as I can remember, I've been the ""quiet, mature kid"". Most people don't talk to me because I'm very ""robotic"", and when they do they either get bored or try to use me as a tool.

Each year has only made me feel more and more alienated from my peers because I can't really feel things; I don't punch things in anger, I don't jump for joy, I don't cry in sadness. No matter how funny I find a joke or a video, things can only make me laugh about once a week at best. I'm just feeling empty. In many ocassions, someone makes a move and I just don't react, killing the mood more often than not.

The other problem is, I don't even have a reason to be feeling empty. No abusive family. No childhood trauma. No bullying. So I can relate and talk to pretty much nobody. 

What I hope is the last problem is: Therapy won't change anything. In fact, the few times I've talked to some, well, one of them ignored me and kept going on and on about how smart people like me will one day change the world, and to not kill myself because I have to make a change... (I still don't understand what that was about, I'm not Einstein's reincarnation, and I still feel empty.)  The others are the generic ""worry about yourself and be positive"" even though that's not flipping an emotion switch anywhere within me.

At this point I think only pills can help my brain be more like that of a normal person.

I'm just tired of it now. I'm only 16 but I think regardless of the age, everyone would. There are many things I want to do, but they're pointless if I still feel nothing. I'd rather cry at my homework rather than feel empty at parties. Did anyone feel like this before taking antidepressants? Did they help you?"
380,Very confused about myself,depression,Hi folks just felt like letting things out. I am very fearful of taking up responsibilities at my job. Also feel very lonely in life and cannot stay with myself due to constant anxiety and thoughts about not doing anything to change my situation. Nothing seems to give satisfaction to me. I am unable to take decisions for myself and cannot focus on things. I just don't know what should be my next steps. I feel I am responsible for my own position but don't see a way out.
381,Do you feel like winning the lottery would either cure or make your depression better?,depression,"I have nothing, no one who cares, so now my emotional connection instead goes to things I can or want to buy. They are filling the void. I feel I would be happier if I won."
382,Is it possible to be born a psychopath but develop a sociopathic behaviour over time?,depression,"What I mean is: Is it possible to behave both like a phychopath and a sociopath; can both personalities overlap? Now, I think I might need some clearing up here because I'm starting to think I'm getting things mixed up. So, if anyone can answer based on my description, I would be pretty thankful.

I would describe myself as a person who doesn't like interacting with other people but gets some kind of satisfaction everytime time they do, but in the  end they regret having done such things and start hating themselves.

My humor is kind of strange as well. In short, I like to weird people out. The way I usually do this is by taking into account the other person's deep thoughts and understanding of various things such as their humor, what they are grossed out by, what they are going through, what they know and what they don't know, to name just a few. Although I always try not to harm them, it can sometimes get out of hand and start a fight.

I had a really strange condition where I always need to watch out not to get *metaphorically* stabbed in the back. To accomplish such a thing, I push myself to the very limit thinking that average or medium capacity isn't enough so I try to give my very best every moment using 100% of my scarce brain power to improve, but most importantly, to solve every single problem I have only for everything to remain the way it is. The way I solve problems is going straight to the root of it without hesitation because I think it's the most efficient way of solving a problem.

I have some disturbing events happen to me which I will not enounce just because I don't feel comfortable publishing them, but basically they have made me be more cautious about my social interactions not to repeat such events. Plus, other people's words have such a huge impact on my so called by myself ""pride"", so we could say I am quite sensitive.

To finish it all, the icing on the cake is the fact that I have this problem where I can't bother to change a thing about my personality because that would be time consuming and I really can't see any definitive way of accomplishing such a hard task. 

Judging by my description and your knowledge, can you find an answer to my question?"
383,That Broken Piece,depression,"Let's see... where to begin?

If feel like shit. All day. Every day. There's a part of me that's broken; someplace deep in my brain. The part that makes me move. The part that allows me to focus. The part that's crucial for happiness... yeah... that parts gone.

I'm a shell. A husk. Not even fully human. The light that shines inside the rest of you, mine has faded to dying embers.

You know what it's like, don't you? If your reading this, I'm sure you understand.

You understand the darkness. How its cold embrace is so familiar and inviting... a promise of a warm blanket hidden inside cold lies and empty tomorrows. The grey swollen clouds hang over head always. There is no sun, no joy, no happiness... just the cold dark.

The worst part of it all?

I'm smart.

I'm talking Mensa Candidate smart.

I could have been anything: a surgeon, a pilot, an astronaut, an architect, a lawyer... hell... I could have been president.

But the darkness... My god... its grip is like a vice. It holds so tightly, so completely... it feels like its impossible to break free.

You feel it too, don't you. Like part of you; the part that wants to be free and happy, the part that yearns for joy and life and fulfillment... It's in there... deep inside, locked in a box and trapped in the dark, screaming, yelling, crying to be free... silent in the unending darkness.

I made a plan. 

I sat down and planned it all out...

My life.

Some exercise here, some work there, some time to save and build and focus...

It would take about nine months. It would be hard... but oh so easy. It's just time, after all. Time we all have. Time we all take for granted.

And I would be happy. I would be fit. I would be successful. I would be a new man.

I showed the plan to the darkness and it laughed.

\*""No.""\* it whispered. \*""Stay here. Stay right where you are. Why leave? You know what's at the end of that road. Pain. Disappointment. Heartache. And me. even if you try... even if you take those first steps... I'll be there. I'll always be there. You will never be free of me. I am with you... always.""\*

I cried. Tears of pain, and rage, and hallow wishes.

I prayed. Prayed to a God, any God, not believing in any of them.

I sit here now, slowly killing myself, slowly allowing the darkness to consume me.

\*Do I taste good, fucker?\*

I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of hoping. No more wishes. No more plans.

No more.

Fight your battle, if you must. I'm rooting for you. But my fight is done.

I lost.

I lost hope. I lost the will. I lost myself.

There's only the dark now... and soon... there will be death.

I have failed. My greatest fear has been realized.

I am nothing even though I have everything: A great wife. Good kids. A nine to five. Talent... my god... the talent. I'm handsome. I wont be gracing the cover of any magazines, but women look twice. Family. Friends. They are there too...

 But the darkness turns it into nothing, it makes me focus on whats not, instead of appreciating what is.

What a jest the universe has played; to bare you into a world of light and song and joy and love and potential and possibilities... and then saddles you with this dark passenger; this endless whisper... this eternal torment.

Perhaps I will find peace in the boundless nothing that comes next.

It's quite there, I think. At least I wont hear the screaming of my dying soul anymore.

Farewell."
384,Help Me Please,depression,I. Just. Want. To. Be. Better. In so many ways! 😭
385,.,depression,i need to talk to some one so  bad i cant stand this no more
386,Help me please,depression,"TW self harm/suicide

How do i not get overly attached to anyone who seems a little bit nice to me? ( Sorry for the bad english I'm French) It hurts so much everytime i got those messages. I know the don't love me, I know they will say no, but everytime i meet someone who care a little more about me than the average stranger, I fall in love desperately. I keep a mark at every rejection i get (so far 26 scars) and everytime I say to myself ""it's the last time"" but i can't help it. I'm asking for help cause the last three times i thought I could end it all, and the last one went pretty close, i downed whole bottle of whiskey and 4mg of xanax I don't know how I'm still alive and I am scared of what I'll do the next time I get this far. It really hurts me, at a physical level. I get sick for a week, it feels like i get punched in the head for hours and my guts are torn appart. It ruins my life, I can't stand it anymore. I thought this time it'll be easier. Damn i even quitted xanax for two years. But the last one caught me and I've relapsed again. Please tell me how to overcome this, how to stop falling in love."
387,Feelin real hollow.,depression,"Lost in all the thoughts I've been ruminating on for far too long and I don't know where else I can go from here. Surrounded by people and I'm still all alone, everything I see, hear and feel is just so depressing.

I've wanted to write all day and even had some words in my head I'd've probably liked to write down but I didn't. I've got no one to share anything I write with. No one who is interested in what I've got to say, what I feel, or me at all in general. I've been trying to reach out, make some connections, find some people who may actually be, but I can't seem to find anyone.

Just all alone all the time. Feeling worthless. Feeling like everything I do is pointless. All alone and always hurting."
388,Am i a terrible person?,depression,"When people around me have bad days i am always there for them although i myself am a mess.
But in other days no one even checks on me. They only reply when i am the first one to text. 

Am i a selfish person to expect a bit of love in return  of me being there for other's during their bad times?
If yes, please let me know how can i better myself."
389,How do you know it’s time to get therapy?,depression,I don’t know what’s going on with me these few days. I keep overthinking everything and everything just feel like a lie. I think I have reached an all time low. I want to seek help (not friends or family) but I don’t know how. I have medical so I’m pretty sure it will be covered but I also feel very ashamed and embarrassed. What if they think what I’m going through is nothing compared to the millions of other humans beings. How are we suppose to feel like we matter ? I don’t feel like I matter or that my existence is real. I want to feel ok.
390,OCD and LSD?,depression,"Hey guys, does anyone know how LSD impacts diagnosed OCD?

391,i cut for the first time in two years last night,depression,"i’ve been thinking about doing it again for a while. the past six months have been my own personal hell. i just ordered a pack of razor blades from target and i plan on cutting again (i used an old box cutter last night). i don’t want to kill myself but i wouldn’t mind if i ceased to exist. it’s not that i wanted to distract myself from my emotional pain, it’s more like i wanted to reinforce what a piece of shit i am to myself. and it worked, i feel disgusting and pathetic, and i know that it’s not the right way to go about anything. i’m just so miserable."
392,Scared,depression,"Hi all.

I am not officially diagnosed with depression, but I'm quite sure I'm depressed. I'm tired of everything. I still try to learn new stuff on my skateboard or guitar but it only makes me feel worse. I give up way too fast and it makes me feel even more worthless.

I really want to talk to someone (my boyfriend knows) but I'm so scared. I need help. I'm too scared to call my GP or open up to my supervisor (he's like a father and I'm welcome to talk to him). I also want to tell my parents but I'm so scared. 

My feelings are only getting worse and I'm constantly thinking about what stuff I'm going to leave behind for my loved ones. I want to make a box for every person in my life with stuff that I want them to have so they can look at it when they miss me.

I keep hearing my dad crying in my head, because he once thought I didn't want to live anymore. He called my mom and I heard him crying in panic through the phone. I don't want to do this to them. I want help. But I'm too scared..."
393,Why I cannot find happiness even in my imaginations???,depression,"I have figured it out today , I cannot end any story I am imagining or daydreaming it a happy ending nor feeling happy even a little while imagining it . I have litterly sat on my bed for almost an hour trying to imagine a story and end it with a happy ending and I couldn't do it . It's like there is a part of me that thinks depression is considered a normal thing and this part loves it and cannot live without it . Can anyone relate ?"
394,Maybe I just need to vent,depression,"Kinda long...but I tried to make it as short as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year me and my SO of 8 years split up. We have 3 kids together. I stayed in the house we were living in (and she was helping me) until the beginning of this month. Fucking weird but I had to move back in with my parents. I haven't really seen them much in the past 8 years because of some crazy shit that went down when I was younger. Long story short, me and a woman back then had a kid, shit in my life hit the fan and I lost custody of him because I couldn't even afford to hardly take care of myself. Then my mom swooped in and just completely through me under the bus and took custody of him. Things were ok at first but we would get into heated arguments on ""who was the REAL father"". So over these past 8 years I haven't seen him much because my parents are just complete shit. But yet, here I am...after simply asking if I could stay here over the course of a couple months.   
Well now I don't get to see my daughters a whole lot either. I work 6 days a week ( because finding employment in my current situation is complete and utter garbage. ) so when I get to the house today I ask my mom if I couldn't go and pick up my girls tonight. (FYI my mom is the picture perfect fucking  narcissist ) She begins to spout out how ""school starts tomorrow again and this and that"". Basically her way of saying no. Just to build some context I was visiting my girls a couple nights ago and when I was about to leave they were crying and everything so I was like ok ok I will take you guys with me. Well when I get back to my parents house and go to say hello my mom gave me the fucking stink eye and starting going off about how she was sick and shit. So I ended up just getting me and my girls a hotel room so I could see them that night.

  
Idk...but this is all becoming too fucking much. Me being there for my girls means absolutely everything to me....but I have no way to see them...like...WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO?!? I mean these people are so fucking petty that you can TASTE the fucking jealousy because my son (who has been with them these past 8 years) is so connected to me ( even though he doesn't know who the fuck I am ). I mean I am really at a breaking point here, it's either live here or live out of my fucking car. Since me bringing my girls over here ( for just ONE fucking night a week!! ) is too god damn much I am thinking about just living out of my dam car. Or just calling it fucking quits. 

Sorry, I know this was a long ass post but holy fuck I am just...completely beyond being able to process this anymore."
395,I’m lost,depression,I had to fight my dad to protect my mam and it got bad o got disowned by both and I’m ashamed that I hit him and now my mam hates me for hitting him because she dosent want him to leave and I’m making her choose but she chose him so I can’t anymore
396,"I've been diagnosed by multiple doctors, but I don't believe them",depression,"I just feel like a part of me is faking it. Not on purpose, but I feel like maybe I'm just being sorry for myself and I need to snap out of it. 

If I am diagnosed, are the professionals ever wrong? Is it possible that they can't see through my bullshit?"
397,Parents think I’m still “In Control” when I’m feeling depressed,depression,"I haven’t been treating my parents the best as a result of my most recent depression wave, which I receive treatment for. They say the medication is just there to “help” and “I’m still flying the plane” regardless of how emotionally distraught I may be. I have both Bipolar disorder and a mild cause of autism spectrum (Aspergers). I believe this new wave to be seasonal and I’m talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow about possibly adjusting my medications.

I simply say things that may be insensitive to them without thinking about it and they usually let it go, but today we got in an argument and I explained how I feel and they said they’re tired of me treating them with disrespect and that depression is no excuse. They also have my 2 younger siblings on their side about it. Everyone in my immediate family wants very little to do with me lately because of my mood. I’ve tried apologizing too but anytime I mention that I’m very depressed (haven’t been finding happiness in almost anything and feel internally miserable) they are quick to tell me I have no reason to feel like that (let me live for free since I’m 22, do favors for me, make dinner, etc.) I tried to explain that my thoughts are not rational and I TRY to think of those things but they are very firm in saying I’m in control no matter what.

It got very bad today in that heated argument, and I really don’t want to risk getting kicked out or compromise my relationship with my family. What can I say or do to help them understand what I’m going through and that I’m not myself at all when I’m depressed? I’m trying to get myself more help and told them about it. I feel like I have no real support other than being told to “change my mindset” or “choose a different attitude”."
398,Why,depression,what made me such a broken person
399,I don't know anymore....,depression,"This is a long post. Very long. I just needed to vent about everthring....

As the title suggest...I really don't know. I don't know if I can continue with what I feel is a hollow existence of mine.

These past couple of years have been horrible but like many of you might agree 2020 is hell. I started my year off on a sad foot because I stepped up to the plate to care for my terminal grandmother. She had 9 kids but none of them put their lives on hold for her. I did. I was already feeling like a failure because school didn't work out because my mother didn't file in time for my FASFA and it got so expensive I had to drop out my first semester. I was devastated. Now I owe the school over 5k and I can't to back to school until then.

Anyways, I came back to my hometown and carried for my grandmother because I love(d) her with all my being. I stayed those long, painful nights by her side. I was losing my mind watching my grandmother waste away. Meanwhile, I had not a cent to my name unless it was the little 100 dollars my mom sent twice a month. I was broke, didn't have a car, and was 24/7 caretaking. 

However, I didn't blame my grandmother but I started feeling guilty because I would want her pain to stop. I wanted her to go home and be at peace. I felt evil wishing her what she wanted,  death.

Then, when her kids finally came around she took her last breath. I was there. Like I promised her. I cleaned her up and got her ready for the hospices nurses to pronounce her time of death. 

I must admit there were days I would look at her kitchen knives, imaging that familiar sting and bite of a knife. This time though I didn't want to just feel the cuts. I wanted to feel Death wrap me in her sweet embrace. Then I would snap out of it and remember I was all my grandmother had in the end. She begged me not to ever leave her and I didn't. 

Since she has passed I know live with my mother...again. I love my mother but I don't really like her. 

When I first cut myself I had to be either 13 or 14. I was able to pull it off and lied and said the dog was scratching me. She believed me...until the cuts became more like carvings. 

My mother had a large wooden paddle she used on me and my brother. She beat me because I cut myself. My butt was swollen for days.  Funny thing is...my mother was a fucking psychology major who wanted to help adolescents. I always find that rich and ironic. 

There are plenty of things I resent her for and those are one. Anyways, I live with her and her long time partner. I hate it. I feel like a failure. I don't have a car, no license, nothing to show any success. 

Now I'm spending the holidays with my boyfriend and it's been the Hoildays of Hell. He hated the Thanksgiving meal I eagerly made him. Two days of laboring for him to say the only thing that was okay was the turkey. We've argued almost everyday since I've been here. He's rarely here, first it was him taking finals (I understood) now he's pulling as many shifts at work he possibly can. So, I'm alone at the house with no human interaction. I have no friends. I sit here and reflect on how I have failed and accomplish nothing. 

I quit my call Center job I had because the people were abusive, it was sickening. I got a job a really wanted but their training schedule is legit once a day every couple of days. The first check I got from them was 33 dollars. They only pay 10 dollars and hr. So, I'm crazy broke,  I have a weekly bill that I can no longer afford, and this is the first Chirstmas I won't be able to buy anyone anything. To top it all off Amazon overdrawed my account by almost 90 dollars for something I still haven't recived.

I try to count my blessings but each day they become lesser and lesser. I find myself in bed until the day is almost over. Not doing anything. It takes so much energy just to feed myself.....I just don't know anymore. 

I apologize for the novella....there's so much more I wanted to type 😊..."
400,I don't even know what to believe any more,depression,"Okay, this is probably going to be a long post/rant, but I need to write it for the sake of my sanity because this has caused me to spiral into a new level of depression and anxiety.

The last 2 years have been rough for me and my family (wife and 2 kids under 10). I left grad school 2 years ago while completing my PhD (which is now finally ready to submit this coming week so I can officially be done with it). We moved from the Northeast back down to the Southeastern US to live with my mother. We did this for several reasons, primarily because of financial limitations. During that timeframe, my wife began to notice some of my mom’s habits that were concerning (my wife is a mental health counselor). For the most part, I didn’t interpret them as quite so serious because they were mostly things like putting stuff away in weird places and losing everyday items (sometimes for days or even weeks at a time; things like keys and cell phone). We all lose shit from time to time and/or misplace things, so I just chalked most of it up to general absent-mindedness that comes with age for all of us. 

But shit really started to hit the fan about 6 months ago, and snowballed on us in the last 2 weeks. Since we had lived with my mom, she’s been convinced that people have been stealing things from her house. Her accusations were, at first, primarily levied against a couple of cousins and an aunt and uncle of mine, a couple of people in the neighborhood known to have stolen things in the past, and a shady woman that had lived with my mom for a short period before we moved in. It was impossible to prove any of these people had really stolen anything, so we just sort of listened to mom and tried to alleviate her concerns by telling her we would be mindful not to let anyone she suspected have access to the house. I even installed some security cameras and flood lights to go with a new backyard fence (I didn’t install the fence). A little security surely couldn’t hurt. 

Another part of the reason that we couldn’t prove any of the aforementioned people had stolen anything, was because most of the items mom claimed were constantly being stolen were things like batteries, light bulbs, laundry detergent, and other every-day use items. And to be clear, there were at least 2 valuable things that had gone missing but both of those items appear to have gone missing when the shady woman was living there (and we are convinced this woman stole at least those 2 things because others who also knew her have noted that she’s a thief). But the majority of the alleged items going missing, were not exactly the sort of thing one takes to a pawn shop for cash.

Fast forward to January 2020. Between being unemployed for several months, plus teaching online via Zoom once the Fall 2020 semester started, in addition to the pandemic/lockdown, I was home every single day. I know for a fact that there was no one coming into the house and stealing shit. But about 6 months ago, mom began to behave more erratically. In addition to the items being “stolen,” she was now also convinced that things were being broken on purpose, and that people where she works were conspiring against her to get her fired. She had cut off contact with several of her friends as well as some family members because she was convinced that they were part of it, and then she began to lash out at me, accusing me of being part of this all in some way. We had a big fight, which really only resulted in me being more confused, but I still (for the most part) believed her. After all, where she worked has a track record for forcing people into early retirement or get fired, and maybe some shit had been stolen since we had lived there because I certainly couldn’t prove otherwise. 

Then, about 2 weeks ago came the final straw that broke the camel’s back. Again, she blows up at me and my wife. She can’t list anything that’s been stolen since January when I’ve been home every day, but she’s still convinced stuff is being stolen and that we’re either allowing it to happen or actively helping in some way. She’s convinced that “they” are breaking things to fuck with her and make her feel insane, and in addition she accuses us of breaking things that are costing her massive amounts of money (never mind that the things that have broken since we’ve been there have been largely replaced by us and definitely haven’t come at her expense: like the oven/stovetop and garbage disposal). Now she’s directly of accusing us of working with a group of people to steal/break things to drive her insane. She even accuses us of either deleting videos from the cameras I installed or letting these co-conspirators have access to the cameras to delete the videos. That’s the only way she can justify the paucity of evidence from the cameras. She accuses us of working with people we don’t talk to, don’t know, have never met, or haven’t seen in decades. In her mind, her sister and brother-in-law (my aunt and uncle I mentioned previously) are working with people in the HR department plus supervisors where she works, plus the wife of an ex-husband, plus the people in the neighborhood she’s accused previously. None of it makes any sense to my wife or I, not even if we try and bend the rules of logic to try and understand the conspiracy she’s presented us with. We tell her that, based on her telling us that she’s talked with some of these people and they’ve all but confirmed we’re in on this conspiracy, she needs to give us contact info for these people because if they are using our names then we need to have a word with them. She refuses, blows up at us one last time, tells we need to move out, and walks away. 

So, I do the only thing I know to do at that moment, I drive to my aunt and uncle’s house (the aunt and uncle she believes are the brain-trust behind this whole thing). Now, I haven’t talked to my uncle since at least 2010 at the funeral of another uncle of mine, and I haven’t spoken to my aunt since before the pandemic when she sent me a text (not to mention I’d only spoken to her in person once and exchanged maybe 2-3 texts since we had moved into mom’s house). We’ve also specifically avoided this particular aunt and uncle while we lived with mom because of the tension she said existed between them, we didn’t want mom to think we were siding with anyone against her because we genuinely fucking weren’t. 

If they were conspiring with anyone to do anything to mom, I was going to find out (my wife also ended up driving out separately and showed up while we were there). One thing I knew for sure after talking with them, is that they were definitely not part of any conspiracy to steal mom’s shit nor drive her insane. They were blindsided by most of the accusations, but were even more shocked to find that mom had said such hateful things about them to us because she believed that they hated her and were jealous of her. 

I’m still completely floored by all of this, but that day I cried more than I had since my aforementioned uncle passed. My wife and I knew something was definitely wrong with mom, whether it was a highly unlikely conspiracy that made no logical or rational sense and had no evidence to substantiate it, or that something was mentally wrong, it didn’t really matter. We found a place the next day and moved our shit the day after that. We knew it would be a bad idea to stay there any longer with our kids. We have essentially no money and had to borrow enough from my wife’s sister to cover the deposit to move into our new place. We were on a shoestring budget before but now we’re really stretched thin.

We also tried to do as much of the packing and moving as we could without telling mom, but found that to be futile because it was clear (based on text messages she sent us) that she was using the cameras I had installed to watch us. The day after we moved out, she changed the wifi password and had a home security system installed. She has since continued to text either me, my wife, or both of us long rants about her conspiracy. Most of it seems to at least hint that she is not actively accusing us right now of anything, but the shit still doesn’t make any sense and the conspiracy has now grown to include my dad (who doesn’t really have anything to do with my mom any longer), my half-brother (who probably hasn’t spoken to my mom is 30 years), his wife (I’m not even sure if they’ve ever met or spoken to one another), and even the cops because they responded to her home security system going off (probably set off from inside by the dogs) and didn’t catch anyone doing anything. She’s said that she’s found pennies and random bits of wire under some of her windows and that this is apparently an old trick the cops do for…some fucking reason that’s nefarious. 

I don’t know what to believe with respect to my mom any longer. We are now seriously concerned that we’re seeing signs of early onset dementia or a stroke. Concerns that are serious enough that a different aunt of mine (who is a former nurse who’s late husband suffered from Alzheimer’s) has been trying to get mom to talk to her and to at least consider seeing a doctor. But thus far, nothing seems to be working and she just keeps going further down the rabbit hole. You can’t help someone who is convinced they don’t need it.

I’m not even mad anymore, I’m terrified. I’m scared for her. I’m concerned that her illogical and irrational beliefs will turn into illogical and irrational actions. I don’t want to talk to her, not only for my own mental health but because thus far nothing I’ve said to her has done anything but make things worse and send her further into these paranoid delusions. 

I don’t know if my mom is “insane,” but I do know she believes highly illogical and irrational things that have led her to accusing her son and daughter-in-law of trying to actively harm her mentally and financially, in addition to kicking us out along with her own grandchildren during the middle of a pandemic and the fucking holiday season. 

2020 has been a shit-show and I already knew the holidays were going to suck, but now it’s a full-on clusterfuck with no end in sight."
401,Feel she doesn't take me seriously,depression,"So, I guess I could say I've been feeling pretty depressed since the start of the year. Recently I had a mental breakdown and my mom catched me, so I spilled the beans. I told her I didn't like myself and felt bad. She just told me that I had to be strong, to find the strength somewhere to overcome my negative feelings, but I told her it wasn't so easy, that I can't. I can't do it. I feel she isn't taking me seriously, she told me I could talk with a friend of hers that ""specializes in emotional problems"" idk if it's an actual therapist or what but I agreed. Still, I think she thinks I'm only kinda sad, but I also feel like it's my fault for not communicating well my emotions, for not telling her I've actually been feeling like shit the whole ass year. But if I tell her that I think I'm depressed, would she take me seriously or just say I'm being dramatic? I don't know what to do."
402,Wish I wasn't born,depression,"Lifes fucking cruel man. People externally have it much worse. Like I could be starving in African dying rn. But internally is just hell for me. Im so tired of it all. All my life I am gonna have to deal with people being in relationships, people not being mentally ill, people having lots of sex and being attractive, having good jobs, talents, etc..

Meanwhile i'll never have that. Everyday i gotta live knowing life could have been good but instead i live in the shadows where it isn't. I feel worse for being so depressed and suicidal because i was born in an ok home in an okay country. But my mind makes me so depressed. Life does. My ugly face does. Im so dumb, useless. I hate life. thanks for reading"
403,It’s been over three years,depression,"It has been three years since my girlfriend took her life. Three years of fighting the pain that it brought me. This is not a message to tell you that things are still difficult. They are, but I am so much stronger than I ever was. This is a message to those of you who may think that things are not going to get better. I am living proof that it does. I had never experienced anxiety/depression and panic attacks until that year that everything happened but now that I have and gotten to a point where I can tell you I barely feel anxious or depressed because I refuse to feel that way again. I write this message not at a time where my life is going well. My life is actually all over the place at the moment to be honest. But I am still confident that depression and anxiety is something you may overcome and become strong enough to defeat it to the point it barely impacts you. You can do it. I promise. 

I wish someone could have told me this years ago so I hope this message reaches someone in that same position and they can skip a few hard steps I had to go through. Much love."
404,I cant deal with this,depression,"You dont have to read this, I just feel like ranting.
I cant deal with having nobody. I cant deal with 10 exams a week. I cant deal with 6 hours of homework on top of going to school. I cant deal with being constantly ignored. I cant deal with being called a disappointment by my teachers because of my stress. I cant deal with struggling to get out of bed every day. I cant deal with constant fatigue. I cant deal with 4 hours of sleep. I cant deal with constant insomnia. I canr deal with panicking over anything. 

Worst of all I cant deal with being a disappointment to my whole family."
405,Finding it difficult to finish anything,depression,"I've been struggling with feeling very depressed for about 2 years now after I left my course at university in my second year. Since then, I have been struggling immensely and I feel simultaneously I'm having difficulty keeping my head above water and just muster up energy to do everyday tasks like showering and brushing my teeth but also feeling like I don't accomplish anything. 

I feel like I start tasks but then something stops me from finishing and I become very down on myself because I feel I haven't accomplished anything in two years. I have no job, moved back home and I have an online course that I just can't seem to finish. I fo feel like if I finish something I won't get so down on myself but all these things feel like mountains on my shoulders and feel so overwhelming. Is there any way to get things done and accomplish anything when it feels like a struggle to even look after myself?"
406,Why should I?,depression,"Everyone destroyed my world. Everything that made me spacial, just for me to be stuck in theirs and get treated like a failure."
407,Don't know who to talk to so I'm here,depression,"I tricked my mind into really thinking I was doing alright... But tonight I just broke down. I just got out of a toxic relationship, which is good, to be set free but... I still miss them? 
On top school and work are just so stressful I can't even think straight. It's the middle of the night and I have to get up early. My thoughts as also this post are all over the place... I have a major migraine. I don't wanna be alone but even if someone was there what would I say? I just wish someone could hug me and tell me that everything will be ok. We both know I wouldn't believe it but it still gives comfort to hear it, doesn't it? The warm sincerity in the voice of someone who genuinely cares? I just wish I wasn't this tired and exhausted all the time. I wish I was pretty and thin and had friends and money to do fun things. But well everyone's allowed to dream I guess. Till then I'll just keep telling myself that one day it actually will be better and I will be happy and I will be alright. 
Surviving even at the cost of loosing yourself completely, is priority number one."
408,"Can't talk to anyone rn, just a rant",depression,"I don't know whether anyone will see this, or read it. I just want to get it out. 

I've been having a really shitty week. I'm just so tired. I can't get up, can't do schoolwork, can't sleep, and I just feel so exhausted. I'm so tired of everything, and I just want it all to end. I feel like a terrible person, I AM a terrible person, but I'm so tired that I can't even bring myself to fucking care. I hate myself for not being able to get up, not being able to do anything productive, and I'm failing my classes. My mom isn't helping at all either. Every time I go through a depressive episode, she refuses to believe that I'm depressed even though I've been diagnosed for a few years now. Its like if she pretends its not mental illness, I'll magically get better. 

An hour ago, she woke me up, told me to get up. I said I couldn't, that I'm too tired, so she yelled at me. Said I need to just suck it up, get up, do schoolwork. Said that if I can't even do something as simple as getting up that there must be something seriously wrong with me. And maybe she's right. I feel like I'm so selfish, so lazy, that I'm not actually depressed. Maybe I'm just faking it, using it as an excuse to be lazy and do jack shit. She always says that she's worried about me, and that she'll help me with anything, but if I try to ever explain anything to her she turns it around and talks about herself, never actually listening to what I say. I hate myself for everything I do, yet I'm just to tired to care. I don't even feel like a person anymore. 

Sorry if this doesn't make any sense, I don't really know where I was going with this. Dunno if anyone will even bother to read this. I just wanted to get it off my chest."
409,What do I do?,depression,"I dont honestly know what to do, there's one thing tying me to this world right now and thats (as lame as it is) my chameleon, Bandit. Hes really wonderful and ive spent every day for a year taking care of him after I got him, we aren't sure how old he is but we think he's at least 3. I recently boarded (kinda like petsitting) him at a store I go to regularly but I got him back and he doesn't look so good.

Im not sure what I'll do if I lose him. I have family and friends, and I know they love me, but the question is, are they worth living for? All of them have hurt me and honestly I forgive them each time but life is just really hard. I know people say that they're worth living for but for some reason the only thing I can think of when I think of living is Bandit, I take care of him and he listens to me (even though he can't hear) but we work on a mutual trust based relationship. I dont disrespect him and his space and in turn he comes to me willingly which is a hard feat for chameleons. 

Its honestly sad that I can't imagine living in a world without a lizard because I know, its just a lizard, but I built a bond with him that I dont have with anyone or anything else. He treats me with the respect that I give him. I dont know what else I can live for if he leaves me

I live my life trying to do good things, and make people smile, but whats the point if I can't even smile myself?

I also know this post is lame but I really just didn't know where to turn too, strangers on the internet seem like a good chioce... I was cut from seeing a therapist (my dad apparently thinks he's curing me) and as it stands now I've been diagnosed with depression but there are a lot of branches to it. Im not sure how it all works but my parents don't actually believe in it"
410,I just want to get away from here,depression,"I see no future in my life. I feel stuck in where I am in life and in my mind. Ever since I have stopped running, I have thought about my life and I don’t want to live like this. I feel like I have no friends that I can talk to and I think about my future and how I will be working a job for the rest of my life and I don’t want to live like that. I really want someone to talk to, so if you would like to talk please dm me."
411,I crave darkness and nothingness.,depression,"For the past few months, I've been craving darkness and nothingness. I just want to dissappear into this cold, dark space of nothing. I don't want to think or feel. I don't want to be in this body. I just want to melt into the wall of something and not be in this skin. It probably sounds stupid but I kind of just want to be a fleeting spirit. And I feel I can only have this if I kill myself. Am I alone in this or not?"
412,"Tested positive for COVID, I think I should end it",depression,"I tested positive for Covid today. I’m f20 and the youngest sibling in my household. My whole family is so disappointed in me, calling me irresponsible, selfish and that I only care about myself because I wasn’t careful enough and basically that I don’t care if they get sick. I was upset about a flight to Florida I had to cancel for my 21st birthday in a week (because now I have to quarantine) and I had a psychotic episode and now they all hate me even more. I had to isolate in my room-so tonight they had dinner in the kitchen without me and I heard them talking shit about me the whole time. If my father sees me he says “BACK UP BACK UP GET OUT OF HERE”...I feel guilty for almost everything I’ve ever done in my life, and this is the worse possible thing to have happened right now..I feel like an evil person. I can’t stop crying the whole day, I’ve been banging my head on walls and beating myself up. I don’t know if I can go another 10 days locked away in this sickness/depression. I’ve been thinking about it for a while and I think it would be beneficial to everyone in my household and anyone that’s ever had the misfortune of knowing me if I just kill myself tonight."
413,Cleaning up the Cutter,depression,"I'm a college student and I live alone in an apartment that belongs to my family. I've always struggled with keeping it clean and I guess that very common, but this year it really feels different. Before, I used to clean up at least every 2 weeks, but now I just haven't. I posted this here because I think it has to do with the way I've been feeling, some days I can barely drag myself out of bed. There's also some past trauma that I've been trying to move on from.

I wonder if anyone here has any tips on how to clean my apartment. I just feel like all of this clutter is keeping me in a funky headspace, but at the same time my headspace prevents me from cleaning up the clutter. I've tried starting small, and doing one thing each day, but eventually it all starts feeling so pointless and I go back to where I was before. I've tried making a daily schedule where I plan all the things I want to do, but I end up feeling more and more tired thinking of all the things I wrote and all the times I haven't kept up with said schedule.

I feel like if I just cleaned up I could think more clearly and maybe invite people over, stop being by myself all the time. I also think I would stop feeling so ashamed of myself. But all of this negative thoughts just overwhelm me and stop me from cleaning. 

I also feel the need to clarify that this is a real mess, like theres a gigant mountain of dishes and I don't have a dishwasher so I'd have to wash them by hand. There's also lots of clothes that need to be washed and folded, but I don't have a machine for drying clothes, so they need to be air dried. I also need to clean up the fridge and the stove from head to toe, etc.  What I'm trying to say is that theres no way I could just finish it all in one suddent burst of inspiration. I need to build the habit, and I feel like that's much harder.  

I appreciate any advice about this you may have."
414,What has helped you the most through tough times?,depression,"Hi guys, this is my second post on reddit, and I would like to ask. How did you guys get better? Right now i'm about to graduate and get my bachelors degree, I've lost 45 pounds this year, I'm being active, I'm listening to self improvement podcasts almost daily, I have no economic problems at the moment which usually was a stress factor for me, yet I'm not happy and have had the thought of is life worth living? On the daily, recently. I was diagnosed with depression at 10 years old its been many years, so i'm just looking for some light right now."
415,I don’t know how to help my friend,depression,One of my online friends that lives in the UK is being medically neglected by his parents. He is having suicidal thoughts and his parents won’t give him medication. I can’t do anything because I’m not there and I feel so fucking useless. Please help me.
416,[TW]I just ruined four years SH free.,depression,"I was getting so excited to reach five years. But no. I go and fuck everything up as usual and I even managed to destroy the scar that commemorated the last time. Appropriate, I guess. I don’t get that trophy anymore. I feel extremely unstable and as bad as I felt before I quit. I feel absolutely hopeless. This was the only thing I had going well for me, and I ruined it. It might not sound like much but this has made me feel worse than I have in years. I haven’t stopped crying all night."
417,I did it,depression,"I finally it, almost kill myself... It was the most close dead call i been through. Someone find me, but tell me I'm a coward, a victim... If you see someone ending his life. What you would do?

I finally left my ex wife but find that she has a threesome, 4 dudes relations while we was together.

Any advice to someone who tried to kill himself every night without success"
418,How exactly is a depressed person supposed to cope,depression,"If they can't afford therapy, don't have supportive parents, friends to rely on, and experience no joy from any activity? What can someone like this even do? I feel so hopeless and stuck. I've heard it gets better so many times before. I'm so tired. I can't do it anymore."
419,Vent,depression,"I always have to mess everything up. Why is it so hard not to do that? Now he's saying that it's nothing, but I can't help but think that he's upset. He's not replying like he usually does, and I can literally see that face. That exact face that he makes every time I do something wrong. I can't take it out of my mind and it haunts me the entire day. I can't stand the thought that I had to ruin his day just like that. It feels like I betrayed him. I just want to crawl up in some tiny corner and die so I won't ever do anything that makes him upset again. I want to talk to him so badly, but I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything nice in this life. And even if I did, when I think that he could reply with that voice, and I hear him say that it's fine when it's clearly not, it just breaks me. Why can't I just go somewhere deep in the woods and spend the rest few days of my life there, alone in the cold? That would be a fair ending to this mess of an existence."
420,Post sex depression &amp; Sunday Blues,depression,"I think during my regular day to day life, I just have a sprinkling of depression. Enough to season and flavor the day but not enough to disrupt it too much. A couple exceptions are Sundays and (sometimes) after having sex. For a long as I could remember, Sundays have been extremely depressing. To the point where I could stare at a wall for 6 hours(and have when I was younger) and be 'content' with that. I try to help that by finding something to do but it's almost impossible to push myself to start.

The sex thing is weird to me. I love my wife. But after sex sometimes, I feel depressed. It doesn't happen immediately after - usually the next day. It doesn't happen always. But when it does, I'm pretty sure she notices. I am not a mean depressed but I don't really have the space for happy emotions. 

So having has sex last night and today being Sunday, I am feeling especially depressed.

I don't know that I'm looking for a solution (by all means, feel free to share) but I felt the need post for whatever reason."
421,My only goal anymore is to make each day faster than the last.,depression,Just sick of this shit. Not feeling anything. Not seeing any purpose in anything I do cause no one cares anyway. Everyone treats me like a creep cause of this and it doesn’t help. Sometimes i just wanna fuck it and go on a drive and never stop. I’ve run out of things to say. This took me almost an hour just to think of cause that’s how braindead and careless I am. I’m done trying shit.
422,Can’t Function After Work,depression,"Hi,

Does anyone else feel semi-functional whilst at work, but then absolutely collapse in the evenings/on weekends?

I feel like I put on a front at work, and that I either kind of have begun to believe it, or that I am just too stressed/numb to feel the depression in the working-day. Sometimes it’s there as negative thoughts, tiredness, depersonalisation etc, but it’s not nearly as bad as it normally is.

But then, the second I get home and unpack or whatever, I just collapse. I can’t think straight. The depression kicks right back in. It’s there before work too, in the mornings. 

Is this normal? It’s exhausting. I don’t enjoy my work, and I now can’t enjoy my ‘free time’ either. But because I feel functional at work, I feel like I’m faking my ‘part-time’ depression.

I don’t know what to do."
423,"I know not everything isn’t that bad, but things seem dismal.",depression,"I’m 28 years old and the more I keep telling myself that everything is going to be ok and everything is going to work out, the less likely it seems. 

I feel like I’m stuck and everything just keeps spinning in a circle, and I can’t get  out of it. Day in and day out, I see how all of my peers are doing so well, while I’m in a rut. I don’t know what to do and sometimes the only thing that seems like a solution is an exit. I often find myself fantasizing about dying in different ways: self inflicted, accidentally, etc. 

I know many people have it worse than me, but I don’t think that makes my seasonal depression any less. It weighs down on me, and sometimes I find myself practically in tears in the stupidest places."
424,(Vent) The exhausting pattern (and why I don’t get my hopes up),depression,"Keeping people at arm’s length, rather than letting them in to see everything that I am, is a way smarter approach for me now, it seems. 

In other words, keeping things more casual with people and not expecting anything from anybody makes me feel hollow inside, but at least I won’t get hurt as deeply if they decide to dip out of my life. 

Like, recently I noticed that I don’t have anyone close enough to me in my life that I’d consider a “best friend”, or someone that I trust enough to give my whole heart to. I can only tell around to people that “I’m here to make friends if you want” so many times before I just sound desperate. I *want* someone to *want* my company as a part of their life on the regular so that I feel like maybe I have some sort of purpose. I know now that anyone I care deeply about likely doesn’t care about me in that way. I’ve grown to accept it, as much as it hurts. (I say “grown” like I’m some aged scholar; I’m young; I’m in college).

But when you’re so run down by being by yourself and going through the daily motions of life, you start to feel dull and numbed to everything. People need other people to survive and thrive; as much as I get anxious about socializing with people, it’s better to have someone in my life that I can trust won’t leave me than to have it engrained in my psyche that everyone is purely temporary and that I’m completely forgettable. 

Every friendship I’ve ever been a part of has fizzled out in less than a few years-time. It’s the little things I’m more aware of: hearing from other people less, being left on “read” all the time, less enthusiasm about the prospects of hanging out, keeping conversations short...overthinking at its best. Too often the ball is in their court and it just sits there. I know I shouldn’t expect anything or feel obligated to be responded to, but when it’s almost a pattern, it starts to sting more and more.

Pets are pretty cool though. I’ve had pets my whole life. Maybe I’ll just stick to having cats rather than trying to take opportunities with people like darts and throw them at the wall until something sticks. 

It’s been years of this now. I’m tired. I let myself be disappointed by these things, yeah...but I wish things would work out for sure, just *once*."
425,Nobody understands how difficult it is for me to simply get out of bed,depression,"Everyone I know either blames me for 'choosing' to be depressed or cracks jokes about the fact that I sleep so much.

I wish people understood that depression isn't just 'feeling sad' but so much more. It deprives you of your passions, makes it difficult to concentrate, wears you out, makes you feel angry all the time for no reason, drains you of hope, etc. What's even worse though, is that I also struggle with a fuckton of anxiety. Panic attacks are almost a daily occurrence, along with intrusive thoughts and feelings of depersonalization. 

How is anyone supposed to live like this? It's like all the odds are stacked against me. Why can't I just be normal? I've slept from yesterday morning to today afternoon and I still feel like sleeping some more."
426,Looking for a reason to keep going,depression,"I am 15. Today I found out I got catfished by a person who dislikes me and I have been shaking continuously for 5 hours. I do not know what to do, I feel like everything is collapsing down around me. I need help. 

 The catfish has been threatening to spread multiple explicit photos and videos and I have no hope, I truly believe this will be my breaking point. I have been feeling depressed for the last 1 and a half years without telling anyone, just simply wearing a mask all day, pretending to be happy.

 I feel like nobody needs me or cares for me, I’m always lonely with the only thing keeping me alive is my cat. 

Someone help me."
428,I don’t want to be alone and stuff,depression,"But I can feel I’ll die this way bc that’s the best way for me to live. I’m too emotional and I hate myself for it. Why can’t I just be ok alone, escape and be happy? I’m so weak it hurts and it doesn’t matter how much I rationalize things the feelings and thoughts never fucking go way. I just want to be ok alone bc being around others is too painful...maybe I’m just not doing enough. I just need more distractions. But I’m to the point where I don’t even want to do that...fuck I’ll just sleep and that’ll be the first thing I do or I won’t bother moving at all haha fuck me"
429,is it really worth it,depression,"is it worth living like this? i always hear people say that u never know what could happen and what could change in the future,no matter how worthless and depressed u may feel at the moment but.....is it really true? i hate feeling like this,useless and without any purpose in life.....i'd rather die than live knowing im good for nothing"
430,I'm sick of living here,depression,"I want to move away so bad and can't because... the state of the world 

i hate my fucking job. i thought i'd like doing this but no. NO

had i had more training (or honestly, ANY training considering I was just thrown into this role) I feel like things would be different. the stress is starting to affect me physically. i have a heart condition and i'm scared that i'm just going to keel over. not good."
431,School - how to man up and suck it up?,depression,"Already posted this on r/advice and did not get really good advice

I am sick and tired of going there everyday. It's the same thing over and over again. I don't have any friends, and can't make any, For some reason everyone is against me. I've been thinking about dropping out and not continuing school next year, but my parents want me to continue, so how do I man up and suck it up?

I get really bad anxiety and also have trust issues because all of my friends backstabbed me a year ago.

I would drop out but my whole family would be mad at me and they are the only people I can talk with and be ""friends"" with."
432,Can depression turn into an eating disorder?,depression,"I don’t binge and purge. 

But every time I eat, I throw everything back up 15-30 minutes later. 

I’m under a shit ton of stress right now. I’m fairly positive that my spouse wants a divorce, my job sucks and I get bullied by my co workers, my anxiety is out of control, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to and I can’t take a break because everything rests on my shoulders right now. 

I’m taking Xanax just to sleep at night, but honestly, I’ve started taking it during the day too, just so I stop caring even a little bit. I have too much to do to get caught up with what I’m going through. 

I can MAYBE eat one meal a day. It won’t kill me, I am fat. But I don’t think the constant throwing up is good for my insides or teeth. 

I don’t have time to see a doctor. My job is understaffed as it is, and I can’t afford to take time off anyway. And I don’t even know if I can afford a doctors bill. Even with insurance it’s a struggle to pay everything each month. 

On the plus side, maybe I’ll lose weight."
433,Parenting with depression,depression,"Im someone who always wanted kids. My whole life it was my dream. Then life happened and I prioritized other things because the whole getting married and having kids thing wasn’t happening.

I got married a few years ago and have honestly just not been a good wife. I am a social worker and spend my days caring a lot about people for work, and when I come home I’m exhausted. My husband isn’t particularly supportive and that’s a whole different issue, but I honestly can say that I haven’t really been here for him when he needed me. 

Over the last few months I’ve spiraled into a deep depression. I can barely care for myself much less my husband. I rev up enough energy to be a good support for my clients and that’s literally all I have. Now that I look back at my life I realize I’ve never been a particularly helpful person. I don’t prioritize necessities like doctors appointments and such, and I don’t help my husband prioritize them either. I am so depressed the idea of putting those things on the task list is overwhelming and I shut down. I’m treading water 

I’ve had periods of my life where I was on my a-game. They last anywhere from months to years, but ineviatable the depression sets in.

I’m now at a place where I’m worried about having kids. What if I can’t get the energy? What if I can’t prioritize them? I cried thinking about the towels that needed to be folded yesterday. What do people do when they’re in this place and their kids need them? I’ve honestly thought recently “oh this is why people leave and abandon their kids with family members.” Not that id do that but I’m more empathetic to it. 

My mom suffered from severe depression my whole life. It took a toll on me and still does. Somehow she managed to get it together to care for us though. Would I be able to do the same? 

I’m interested to hear from  parents who have managed to power through those dark periods to care for their kids. My husband says he won’t even consider having kids with me right now because I’m not acting motherly. And I’m at an age where this becomes a now or never situation. I cry just thinking of the idea of never parenting. My friends who have kids have always depended on me for support because I’m so good with kids. I’ve helped raise so many other peoples kids. Would I be able to do it for my own on a daily basis? I always thought I’d be a good wife because I’m a caring person but having to care 24/7 has shown me I’m not so much. Is this the same with kids?"
434,I feel like I'm annoying to everyone,depression,I have a feeling that I'm just annoying everyone. I don't know why I'm like that but for example if someone is not responding to my messages for a very long time i delete them. I only talk to one person now and she says that she doesn't mind but I still have that feeling. How can I get rid of it. How can I be confident again ?
435,I don’t understand,depression,"Most times I feel like I’m not here, like my brain has already left this plane, I have no feelings, I don’t feel happy or sad, just numb, should I be concerned?"
436,The void,depression,The last for years of my life have been the best I’ve ever had. My girlfriend just broke up with me about a week ago. I’ve never loved anyone like this girl. For the last week the only thought in my head has been one of death. I think I may just take the plunge into the void one day. But with every passing day the will to fight that voice gets harder and harder. I don’t think I’m gonna be strong enough for much longer.
437,Chronic illness destroyed my life and i want a GF,depression,"
Its been 2,5 years of suffering, soon 3, and im tired of getting high on meds to the point of barely being able to walk, only to sleep, then look like a druggie the whole day from being sedated. I hate my symptoms, cant even talk about it

I wanted a girlfriend, to at least make me half happy, but who the fuck needs a wreck like me anyways, and i tried, i posted myself on groups, i searched Fb lists, and i cannot make emotional connection somehow,

But.. only with one person, who already has a boyfriend, so she is my best friend. I tell her how i love her everytime im stoned at 3am...

I cant believe i cant find anyone like that, if she didnt have a boyfriend i would just try and you know.. i told her that its only self control, and how i feel, she understands and said she wouldnt be mad even if i lost control over my emotions

I dont want them to break up, i really dont, i have dirty thoughts but i never try to push them apart, i encourage her to stay with him at her bad times.

But then who will be here with me? I would need physical contact, not sexual, only cuddling and stuff that i never could experience in my life.

I have chronic Lyme, adrenal insufficiency, chronic mononucleosis, candida, disbiosis, anxiety/panic disorder, ocd, depression and ptsd. I dont blame you if you dont believe it

Im tired of it all, i just want.. all i want is to not feel bad physical sensations and to be loved 🥺 people fucking take these for granted, i would trade all my artistic abilities only to get this two things in my life.

Im paranoid when i hear sirens, Cause i vent about it everyday, and i never know if someone would call doctors on me.

Im broken 💔 And i will never recover from this"
438,I've been like this for 6 years....,depression,"I don't have anyone in real life who'd listen so I'm just putting it out here.

I'm 20 years old right now and have no job, only 11 years of high school education and no friends. My family isn't exactly broke but my parents don't really care about my further education and I've had no one to guide me academically my whole life. I'm 20 and they won't even care to ask me what my future plans are and I'm not sure they'll invest in me. My dad got married again last year and spends most of his time away from the country which is Fine I never really liked him and he was abusive 

Anyway my actual point was that... I'm tired of living like this and I don't know if I'll ever get out of all this... I have no education or any motivation to get myself out of this cycle. All I do is sleep everyday. I eat to cope and add something to my life but of course it just makes me feel worse in the end because I've been gaining weight. 

I've been stuck like this for 6 whole years and I don't know how to get myself out of it. The cycle is hard to break when it's the only thing I know..

Idk what to do"
439,going in circles,depression,so I though getting my license would make me happy so I did it I thought getting a car and a job would make me feel like I was doing something worth while I thought having a girlfriend would make me feel complete but I met up with this girl and it was not what I expected what am I doing wrong its like I have everything I want but nothing I want at the same time I seek out what I think will make me happy and feel complete but I just keep getting lost in this empty feeling I've had for years
440,Well I just wanted to say that life sucks dick rn I can’t do shit without being judged no matter how hard I try my life is just getting worst,depression,but I’m too much of a fucking pussy to kill myself I only feel useless every day even my teachers are saying how much of a fucking failure of a human being I just wanna end it all
441,:),depression,Over 20 missing assignments in college and I can’t mentally do any of them without breaking down. Literally the most I can do in a day anymore is get out of bed to feed my dogs. I’m gonna fail college and then not get my AA and then not get the career I want and fail life. I’m noticing a pattern. Might as well give up now.
442,dreams,depression,"i hate sleeping sometimes, i have these really vivid dreams and i remember them all, i have suppressed my trauma but it somehow manages to resurface in my dreams in multiple different ways and i hate it sososo much it makes me feel so disgusted with myself ):"
443,The feeling of Indifference no one talks about,depression,"Hey everyone, I wanted to get on here and share my experience with depression as a teen with a very busy lifestyle. I've struggled with depression for about a year now, but it didn't start to get bad until February and has become more and more of a daily struggle since. I have my really dark days where i can barely get out of bed, and i have my good days where I'm able to go hang out with friends and smile. But most of the time I'm somewhere in the middle. a feeling of indifference if you will. Nothing makes me go to the dark days, but nothing brings me happiness either. It's a numbness and sometimes I think it's worse than the days I can't get out of bed. my life demands so much of me since I'm in school and edtraceucciulars so I have no choice but to go out in the world and pretend. except it's not even pretending at this point, because people notice. I go about my day, doing what's needed of me to the best of my ability. I make the grades, I get the positions, and I'm considered ""successful"". Except I'm doing all of this with a feeling of extreme numbness. These things dont bring me joy, and not doing them doesn't bring me sadness. I'm just a shell of who I once was, emotionless... anyways I wanted to get this all our because I feel like depression is so often portrayed with those really bad days of not eating, not sleeping, and just staying in bed. but the reality is, so many people go about their days, but without any real life or feelings. it's just a constant loop where all of the days blend together and you lose yourself in the depression, but no one even notices because you're still ""there""."
444,"I'm 21 years old but I hate my family, relatives, neighbours, friends, society, world.",depression,"I love watching movies series music manga games politics philosophy science religion etc.,"
445,Hitting a Brick Wall,depression,"I've always experienced this lingering gooey feeling inside me . I can't describe it almost but it just feel like constantly wanting to just melt away. I've been really privileged in my life with having an upper middle class family, going to a charter school, studying abroad high school year and having my college paid off for. I don't know why I feel so miserable and irritated when I've been giving everything that some can't have. I feel so guilty and just want to be confident in myself. I don't want kill myself but there's just nothing pushing me forward anymore. I want to go to grad school but im going to fail a Gen Ed math freshman semester because I have such bad math anxiety for no reason.  

 I've been seeing the university counselor and being able to talk to them has realized how bad these feelings have gotten. I wanted to deny feeling like nothing for such a long time because I don't deserve to feel sad for myself. I feel greedy and now that I'm home, I've grown more irritated with my emotionally unavailable dad and my mom who just tries to say that its just because of college. The counselor says I have some unhealthy with anxiety and depression and told me the next time we meet I should try to fix my sleep schedule which may help. But here I am now having nightmares for the first time in years about the only best friend I've ever felt connected and loved by . Its all just coming down on me and I feel so pathetic that I see now that I don't have friends and when I do make them I step away before I get hurt or abandoned.  I've made myself the jester of any group I've been part of because I have no hobbies anymore , im not very smart, I don't have a talent or anything unique about me so I just make people laugh at my idiocy to be part of a group. 

This is just a vent because I don't have anyone close enough to talk to . I'm sorry for the formatting because im on mobile."
446,Sad and Pathetic,depression,"So it’s that time again for seasonal depression. I was doing fine. Only occasionally lonely. I had work, and family. But there was this guy at work, a travel nurse, and we got close as friends. I thought he was cute and funny, but I knew he was trying to get back with his ex, and that was fine because I told myself I wasn’t really interested. Well his last weekend here we got even closer. Someone broke into my apartment and he oversee to stay with me so I would feel safe and could get some sleep. Well it didn’t end up working out the first two nights. Then on the last day, he was really weird to me. He told me that he’d actually liked me, but thought I was shooting him down when he flirted with me. So he came over that night and it was amazing. We talked about anything and everything, and then we hooked up. I knew what it was, just a last night thing. But now he’s gone and I’m so so sad. I think most of it is because I lost my work friend, but part of me thinks it’s the more we started. I’m so depressed now. And I feel pathetic. Now he blocked me on Instagram, out of no where. How do I get over this boy that wasn’t even mine?"
447,"my parents when i wake up late: this isn't normal, please wake up earlier",depression,"my parents when i wake up early: 

oh my god 😱look 😵👉 someone has decided to leave their 🐻 den 😂👌 what a miracle 👏🤣 like are you okay?? 😨 do i need to call an ambulance?? 🚑 😂😂😂"
448,"Lonely, depressed, not good enough and I feel like the things in my head I say about me is true!",depression,"The fact I am lonley and depressed causes me to get attached or become needy real easy. I would not call someone a friend who doesn't doesn't care to reach out to me or talk to me to ask me if I am okay, can we hang out or anything so what is even the point.  I do not have nobody because I am hating Georgia so bad but The fact I am lonely on my birthday just because me or my mom is the only ones who will be there but I ain't got no friends makes me feel lonely. I have showed up for people lots of times but nobody wants to show up for me anymore messes with my feelings which causes me to feel like I do. Whether I be nice or being the depressed person ever but mostly when I am happy still people is going to leave but which makes me not want to do anything which is why I hardly ever leave the house. People is going to keep leaving or either unfriending me or blocking when I did nothing wrong or to deserve it will get me to a point I do have a backup messenger account I will end up going off on people who done that to me and say to them so you do not care about me unlike other people you talk to because nobody stays in my life. I feel like I am on a urge of a breakdown  because of doing to things like this happening and if people don't care then I don't care about myself or feel like wanting to do anything is why I sleep all day but just never find the motivation to do anything! I am tired of people playing games with me and if your not going to not talk to me on Facebook but in public please stop because i ain't got time for these twisted mind games! People doesn't know what I go through so I hide what I go through and be happy to see if people will talk to me but still people leave so I am over it! 

Just know I will never get over a person because when I meet new people they are just like them because everyone is the same because everyone leaves because I can't name a person who never will because people add me to block me or ignore the next day when all I ever do is being nice. I know what I got to do let me anger out, punch something or myself because I can't be something that people wants me to be because me being depressed people doesn't want to talk to me so I tried being happy but still nobody does talk to me. I am disabled and I struggle making friends or even opening up to people like in public because I don't speak first because it's too hard to explain like having social anxiety! I do not know if I can have social anxiety if I ain't diagnosed with something because I am too shy to talk to people first or message because I have no idea what to say or get to know people like I want which I was in special ed in school makes me be afraid because I fear of being bullied because I am a quiet person. 
I get left on read when I speak my mind or say anything and nobody gets back to me over years and 2 years now but I won't go chasing nobody even though I get attached easy and become needy because want real friends including people in my life that can be like a sister to me, close friend or brother I can talk to about anything even if it is music but who will never leave or stop talking to me through my darkest times. 
My birthday is Saturday December 5th.

I am going to be lonely especially them are the same friends who left me when I moved away and because I get treated wrong when i moved away from them and Georgia because it seemed they never wanted to talk to me anymore but decided to talk to me when I was in another state talking about they might as well not be my friend unless I came back, starting calling me and my mom names and talking crap about me because my mom had no way to get me so if I go back to the abuse that is why because nobody and like them who I want to come around won't come back around so I am done because I know he won't leave me like everyone else will do and nobody else I can stay with who will help me because I will struggle alone and I can't get a job because they will cut my check because that is what my mom said they will do if I work because I am disabled. So I got nobody else but him and she doesn't care if I go back to him and when I ask her anything she is like she can't help it so I will not bother talking to her about anything if I am such a burden or a terrible person or a waste of space because he is the only way I can move out of state. It will take all i got living on my own because when I pay phone and buy groceries I am broke so i don't make enough living on my own! I lost my friends and I lost everything so he is my only choice as it seems! Nobody understands mental illness and I shut myself out because nobody gets it because the fact I move away I won't be called mean things my stepdad saids about me or get accused of things that is not true about me when I know who I am and the things he saids I do I don't do.
I am tired of this life and loneliness!"
449,"Please, I need help",depression,"I hope someone will read this. I wanna tell my story
Hey, I'm 16 years old teenager from a small country, which was in war recently (we lost the war, but that's not that important).
I'm a that friendly nerd that every school has, I have finally some friends, but... not everything is ok
My problems with mental health started when my grandpa died, or earlier. I have really toxic parents, even though they love me, they just don't realize they hurt me. They critisize my weight, my style, my fucking everything.
I was bullied in middle school, I was a strange, but I smart kid.
Although I'm in better school now, my relationship with parents got better, but my mental health is getting worse. Every small fucking thing annoys me, I hate the way I look, talk, I think I'm dumb and I don't know anything. But I have no motivation.
I fucking lost myself. Idk who I am, what I love, what I feel. I can't go to a phycologist as in my parents won't allow my, plus it's really expensive for a 16 years old girl...

Edited: Wowww, I didn't expect these much support, I really appreciate that&lt;3"
450,My story,depression,"Quarantine has been really getting to my head recently. All the joy in my life has been completely sucked away. I was in my last year of middle school and was about to graduate. We were going to go to Washington D.C. for a field trip, which I had been looking forward to my entire middle school career.

I was going to have to say goodbye to everyone. My friends, my teachers who I had gotten so attached to after 3 years. It was going to be sad, but I was ready to move on and excited for the future. Little did I know I was about to get into the worst year of my life.

Once quarantine happened, my friends and I were all excited. We thought virtual school would be fun and it would only be for a month. But that month passed. And another. And another. Graduation was virtual and afterwards my friends sent me a bunch of half hearted goodbye messages.

I’ve been stuck inside for the past 8 months now and by life feels completely meaningless. I feel like my life is actively being taken from me. All these memories and good times I was supposed to have have been taken away and I’m worried I’ll have tons of regrets about the things I didn’t get to experience when I’m older.

I’m stuck in the same loop everyday. I go to school on the computer and then spend the rest of my day on my phone. I feel like a complete failure and I’m reminded everyday when I look at myself in the mirror.

I’m in high school now and I don’t know anybody. We don’t really get a chance to talk to each other because the teachers always telling us to shut up. I have no one to talk to and I try reaching out to my friends but they’re too busy with THEIR school to reach out. 

Whenever we do talk, things are really forced and things don’t flow as naturally as they used to. I feel like I almost don’t know them anymore.

 My parents asked me yesterday if I was feeling okay. They’ve been really stressed out with financial troubles because my dads company is going through hard times. I don’t want to worry then anymore so I just fake a smile and say that I’m doing great while I try not to let the sadness overtake me.

Anyway, that’s just how I’ve been feeling recently. I know posting this on Reddit is a weird thing to do but I just need to get all this out of my system. Hopefully this situation we’re all in is over soon so I can move on with my life. Thanks for listening."
451,Gonna start living like there’s no tomorrow (which there won’t be),depression,"I’m planning on killing myself in feb-March. I get to see one more Christmas, even if I don’t deserve it. I will start living recklessly. Soon the world will be relieved of me."
452,Need help,depression,"I(my brother) just accidentally post my Hentai folder on my Facebook's story, but only 11 people watched them. This is high school year and i don't want any trouble, and i really need sone compliments right now, H e l p  m e"
453,Uhh,depression,"I “woke up” at 8 am today. 
But really I had been awake all night. 

Trapped in a maze in my brain of things that are called dreams. 

“Dreams” that aren’t fluffy and start with an angelic harp. Dreams that are really just memories. 
Specific memories that you pushed so far back that awake you didn’t have to know about. 

But the magical thing about dreams is you still feel you still hurt and you start to remember. 

Are you really remembering or are those just little horror movies the dream department put together using left over props and characters from your real life. 

Awake you now gets to lay there. Awake. Remembering. 
Driving your self insane by the fact you are even questioning the gap between “dreams” and real life. 

And now it’s 2:30pm. You’ve wasted your day. You’ve thrown up. You are literally and figuratively drained. 

🎶 🎼 Dream a little dream with me."
454,Coming back,depression,"I thought i had broken free of deprrssion and suddenly it came back and harder this time.

Im confused most of the time, feeling shitty and sad without any reason."
455,How do I open up?,depression,"I feel like this may be an odd question, but I think I can hopefully make it make sense. 

I have been struggling with depression for about 4 years now. I kinda thought that it would eventually just get better but it didn't. I'm thinking it kinda got worse. 

I lost all of my friends, I dropped out of university and am working a pretty dead end job, which I'm actually really bad at. I'll probably get fired. 

I realised that I needed help. The suicidal thoughts and self harming was becoming too much and I feel like there's so much constantly swirling around in my head at any given time. 

But now I feel like I'm so used to ignoring my problems and hoping that they'll fix themselves and I have no idea how to put them into words so that my counsellor can actually help me. 

It probably also doesn't help that I've had no friends for so long that I think I may have completely forgotten how to socialise."
456,I dont know if I should tell my friends that I tried to OD,depression,"Im 14F. A couple of months ago (I think 7 or 8), I tried to OD. Long story short, my family helped me and I'm a bit better now. Thing is, I havent told my friends anything, and my school doesnt know either.

 I personally think loyalty and honesty is super important, andI feel like I'm hiding something from them- betraying my friends by not letting them know.

I dont want them to worry. I want to keep joking around like usual and I feel like it would be disgustingly selfish to tell them about it because it would probably mess with them as I'm usually the more composed person in the group. I dont know what to do, and I havent said anything about it to my family. It's a lose lose situation. I'm not ready to tell them and I dont think they're ready to know, but keeping this secret is awful.
Advice?"
457,I fucking hate my sexuality,depression,"I don’t know if I’m bisexual or just fucked up but I’m mostly straight except I’m into gay bears. I don’t know if I’ve always been a little gay or if I developed this as a fetish. I’m not attracted to men romantically and most disgust me. I want to be with women, but most are disgusted by men who have had sex with men. There’s a chance this could be a phase, but it doesn’t really matter because I’ve already acted on it. I should’ve been terrified to act on it, but after asking people about it (mostly on fucking reddit) they just said to go for it. I used to be confident and very into women, but now I’m fucking terrified of them. My friends all fucking know too and it’s fucking awkward. I can barely get out of fucking bed. I’m going to be fucking alone for the rest of my life because of this bullshit. I feel completely emasculated and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to respect myself again. I fucking hate the lgbt community and exploring their subreddits has made me realize how fucking crazy so many of them are. The community has made me question the validity of my sexuality more than fucking anything. If you’re a guy and you’re thinking about exploring any gay feelings you have, I honestly recommend keeping that door fucking shut unless you’re certain you’re gay/bi. I don’t know how the fuck I’m going to come back from this. I’ve been depressed over this shit for 3 fucking years now. My life is fucking ruined and it’s my fault. I can’t even kill myself because I know it would fucking destroy my parents although my depression seems like it’s already doing that."
458,I always feel like i'm going to die soon.,depression,"Do any of you ever feel this way? I'm not suicidal but i just always have this feeling that i'm gonna die soom.

Sometimes i just wait to die."
459,Irritable,depression,"I've always been quite good-tempered and lenient, quite possibly more than I should; I'd probably be the one apologising if you were to spill tea on my lap. But in the last months I've noticed I've become more and more irritable. I'll be annoyed at everyone and everything without reason, and excessively so. Similarly, I've experienced sensory overload more frequently as well. My mental health has never been good, but it has worsened significantly this past year, and my mood with it, it would seem."
460,Not sure what to do,depression,"I feel completely and utterly alone.

My health is rubbish, my personal life is a mess, and work isnt going well. I have spent the entire day having waves of panic attacks. For the first time in my life, i considered hurting myself. I am empty and lonely, and i dont know what to do. Please please help me, "
461,I try to justify some of my wrongdoings by blaming it on my past to make myself feel better,depression,"Whenever I try to do apologize, or make things, right, or you know justify, for the things I could have done better, or I reacted to it in a way I shouldn't have; to justify myself, my words seems to take me back to the stuffs that happened to me to find excuses(I think so) for my action/behavior.


I don't know what to make of it,
I should be just straight up and apologize for my mistake, which I do, but in my mind, to justify myself, am I just putting the blame to my past? 
I don't think it's healthy. 

I don't know if this is the right sub, if not, please point me to correct sub."
462,"here i am again, two years later",depression,"maybe i'm fine and just want to pity myself but i know what walking the path of spiraling into untreated depression feels like. hundreds of hospital, therapy, and psychiatry bills later, and i'm here. like maintaining an old expensive car.

if you haven't started treatment yet or are at the earlier stage of confused spiraling, just know that it's a long road ahead. enjoy the good moments while they're around and get treatment, it's okay to give up sometimes as long as you don't ((give up))

i almost kinda missed posting here. ha."
463,"I HAD depression, now I have a problem... (sorry for the long post)",depression,"I had depression/anxiety/self-consciousness or whatever you want to call it.  For years, I felt a strong urge of anxiety if school was even passively mentioned. And actually going to school was a nightmare! I would put on this fake face of ""I don't give a crap"" or a ""comedic"" face, but in reality, I felt like every single move I made was being judged for some reason. Even walking incorrectly was a worry. It even transfered over to college. In more recent years I started heavily questioning my own life. ""I'm too afraid of doing something wrong to get a job"" or ""why would anyone watch my videos, there are so many creators better than me"". I would always compare myself to others, and I heavily debated taking my own life for being a useless slob. I even wrote a will. One night, I couldn't take it anymore, and I texted my best friend and asked if he was open to talk the next day. I had never told anyone these things before so this was a big step for me. We've been best friends since kindergarten. We've got more memories than either of us can count. I went to his college campus, and told him the huge history of what made me depressed and why school was so terrible. To his credit, he was a very good listener. He even shared some of his school dilemmas. Apparently, he was bullied/disliked for being my friend. Everyone but him would be invited to events for the basketball team. The fact that he continued being my friend regardless of these things made me cry on the inside. It showed me that people can put on very convincing faces. I finally got to the part of wanting to kill myself. After my story was over, he started talking to me about whether I was saved or not. Now, I'm in a Christian family, and we both attended a private school. I've heard these things hundreds of times. I've become numb to it all. This didn't upset me or anything, since I knew he was just trying to help, but then he made a suggestion.
 ""Did you tell your parents?"" 
Now, I know my parents. I also know exactly how they would react if I told them that I was depressed or had constant anxiety. Without going into details, it would NOT help the problem. Telling my parents might even make it worse, depending. So I responded ""no"" to my friend. I know normally, telling your parents would probably be a good thing, but not in my case. I was more confident in my own abilities to get better without my parents getting in on it. After this, we went our separate ways. It actually helped to share my problem with him, i was surprised. A week later I went to visit him again. This time it didn't have anything to do with my mental state, I just wanted to hang out. Once it was almost time to head out, he asked me about how I was doing. I responded by telling him about how talking really helped. Then he asked it again.
""Did you tell your parents?""
I answered the same say i did the week before. ""It wouldn't help, i know how they'll react""
He wasn't having it. He suggested again that I tell them.
I said no.
He said it again.
I said no.
This happened several times, each time getting more intense than the last. He finally pulled his phone out and threatened to call my mom. I tried convincing him that it will only make things worse, but he wasn't having it. I was half tempted to grab the phone out of his hand and delete the contact info. But I knew he could just get it back if I did. 
He hit the ""Call"" button. When my mom answered, he didn't actually tell her anything, but he basically told her that I have a big problem to talk to her about. I told my mom that I'd call her later on my own phone and hung up. The last thing I told my friend was that he made a big mistake, and to not be surprised to not hear from me for a while. I managed to squirm out of having to tell my parents about it, but the next few weeks were miserable. I was so afraid of them figuring it out, and they were getting close, but they never did. Fast forward to present day(two months later), and I have gotten out of my depression and anxiety mindset. I basically forced it out of myself, if that makes sense. I made a consistent diet, started exercising, judging myself less, and comparing myself to others far less. I'm not 100%, but I feel better than I ever have. My mindset was: ""If I don't have the problem, then my parents won't ever figure it out."" But now I have a new problem. What do I do about my friend? On the one hand, he shouldn't have tried to force a solution to MY problem. But on the other hand, he sort of indirectly helped by attempting to tell my parents. I don't want to never see him again or something. But at the same time, what if he's not convinced and tries to tell them AGAIN, but directly this time. I'm conflicted and I welcome any ideas/advice. I don't know how to confront my best friend again.

Sorry for the long post, but I simply don't know what to do."
464,Sleep?,depression,"Ever feel like you don't wanna go to sleep just because you don't want to wake up?

I sometimes force myself to stay awake just because all the troubles i feel during the day."
465,Does it ever end? Someone make it end,depression,"I wake and I feel depressed, all throughout the day I'm depressed, I'm lonely and I feel useless and pointless. I feel I'm fighting a pointless battle, solely to get up and fall down again, why can't I have love? Acceptance? Relationships? Why do I always need to be alone?"
466,Goodbye Forever,depression,Thanks for your support until now but I have to say goodbye. I will break my chains and elevate towards the sky like the broken angel I was meant to be. I will embrace the soil and let it dissect my flesh prison.
467,Don't really want to keep trying in life,depression,"I (25m) had a really bad time of it in university. I commuted by city bus and despite making a real effort to try to make friends I never really did. I ended up getting a BA and MA in political science and with the exception of my 4th year which was pretty ok. I've been unemployed and I don't like my options in life. I had a decent social life due to beer league soccer and softball but COVID has put a stop to that.

I wanted to work in the civil service or as a cop but I didn't find out until after graduating that both are extremely competitive and I probably won't get hired. My degrees aren't very practical and I just don't want to try anymore in life. I've trying for years and I haven't gotten very far and now I've just been in a slump for a year. 

I'm not interested in retraining but I'm not even interested in applying for jobs anymore

My therapist isn't very helpful or understanding and I'm not interested or willing in taking anti-depressants. TBH I might have ADHD but my GP is a pain to deal with on this stuff.

Any advice would be appreciated!"
468,ive been on a death binge for three years.,depression,"as the title says, ive been trying to drink myself into a fuckin coma.  


because all i want is my family back, im going insane, my biological father kicked me out of my family home three years back, maybe a lil more than that, and i don't see many days when im not drunk as shit and stoned as shit, of course, it doesn't help it, but i cared years ago, i got a place to call my own, but i cant even move in because the government wont adapt the place and put a ramp in because of corona, so who knows, it could be another 7 months, they moved me away from anyone i know just as my family situation was crumbling, and now my sister wants nothing to do with me because i couldn't see her often enough to give her my side of the story face to face, im so sick of being stuck out in this shitty town, ive probably already gone crazy, feels like it.  


i feel like i was forgotten by the system and a good few family members, all i did was flee from someone who had the black heart that could beat disabled women and children, im fucking sick to fuck of the government and the way they treat their hidden homeless."
469,Feeling lost.,depression,"Feeling very lost.

I am a female in my mid twenties. I’ve never actually posted on here so hopefully I am doing this correctly. Post undergrad has placed me in a very difficult situation in life. I have things that should make me happy, a great boyfriend, a great home, I have a job &amp; I’m in graduate school, but somehow I still feel as if I can’t even wake up in the morning. I’m not myself, I’m constantly crying and going through mood changes. I’m silently struggling, while portraying I live a great and happy life to those around me all while feeling like nobody cares about me, because they don’t check in on me. I miss having friends and fun all the time like in college and I just feel extremely overwhelmed with life, work, school, all while going to psych appointments and trying to get myself to go to therapy. I also suffer from adhd, and struggle with the decision to use a medication that helps me perfectly with that, but worsens my depression. I’ve gained a significant amount of weight, which has only made everything in regard to my mental health worse. On top of all that I have severe anxiety and although I have been prescribed 
Prozac and Paxil, I have a large fear of SSRI symptoms. 

Basically, life is hard, I have no one I can talk to about these things so my last step is reaching out on here. Advice and words of encouragement are welcome."
470,Death must be so peaceful.,depression," Today I was riding my bike, coming back from a restaurant after picking up my lunch and on the way suddenly lost control of my mind for a second and had a thought that what if a huge truck just crashes into me and it all ends, all the pain, all the stressing about my future, my grades. For a moment just felt like if I end it all, how peaceful will it be. For that one moment, I just wanted to LET GO."
471,How to work hard in school?,depression,"For some reason, I care about some things and don't care for other things. What I mean is what I value has completely changed.

Sometimes, I keep thinking about my appearance and whether I get along with others.

But I don't care for my future. I don't care about school or college.

I feel that maybe the reason why I care about my appearance and my social skills is because all I care about is being accepted and cared for. I want people to like me. I want people to be affectionate with me and tell me I mean something when I can't help feeling worthless.

I don't know why. It's like I have given up on my future. I can't really think about what the future will be like. I can't really envision my future. I don't care for goals such as getting good grades in school and getting into a good college. I just don't care. I would be fine ending my life before having to deal with greater responsibilities, but it's really difficult to succeed with that. But I know at the same time, as a high schooler, I should make sure I can achieve those (doing properly in school/college), so I can be financially independent and be able to support myself.

But I don't know why goals like that are not connected to my self-esteem but more on purpose. I don't know how to get myself to care. You could say that discipline is only important, but I need to make sure I have a good perspective. We all do certain things because it means something to us, but the thing is I don't care if I do bad in school.

You could say I'm blaming depression. Um, I wasn't like this in the past. I worked hard in school. That was 7 months ago. I was the type of person who would get As. Now, I'm putting minimal effort. I'm just wondering how can I change my mindset. I'm sorry, I know I come across as shallow and attention-seeking and someone who does not care for long-term goals.

By appearance, I mean I'm trying to eat healthy and exercise. By social skills, I want to read more to become interesting. This is ideal tho. Everything's been on and off. It's hard dealing with classes while also dealing with after-school things (taekwondo, tutoring class). Like one week, I try hard on things like being healthy and reading. The next week, I rush on work. I'm not good at managing my time.

I understand discipline is important, but I would like to know if there's a way I can change my mindset. You can definitely call me out in the comments for how I'm being wrong.

I know it's not as bad as others, but I would appreciate advice.

**The reason why I find it hard for me is I was already a procrastinator in the past when I was not depressed.** When I was not depressed, I would use my time after-school reading webtoons honestly, and only at like 9-11 pm, I actually started doing work. But I worked hard. Now, I think things are harder. I'm not using my time on hobbies though. I mainly doing nothing all day - hearing music and overthinking things. I try to get work done, but I feel really down (not neutral) that it's hard to pay attention to work. I feel I need to always keep my headphones on to keep my mood elevated, but I end up paying attention to the music too much. Some days, I cry a lot and I think it gets hard to go back to doing work because I feel really tired. I also have headaches pretty much all the time, and pain medication does not help.

You see, I was the kid who worked hard in school, but I was very lonely. I worked hard because I had a plan, and I had hope that maybe I can be successful in the future. Then, it hit me that I had trouble improving on my SAT and in junior year, I was trying harder than the previous years, and I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. I wasn't doing bad, but I was feeling resentful. It also hit me that maybe my social skills will never get better. So, I should stop thinking that I can postpone things and just focus on studies. I don't have leadership skills or public speaking skills, so I found it hard to get leadership positions in extracurriculars. I also had the realization that I'm below average, so I care more about my appearance. I always felt insecure about it, and I felt I always gave people bad first impressions. I really want to get along with people, and I feel maybe lookism had something to do with why I was having trouble.

I feel that with me in the past, because I had goals, I could do the work because I would feel good that I'd be doing well in school and if I told myself that I would do bad if I don't work on this now, I would work hard because I wouldn't want that to happen. It was like maybe a carrot-stick system. The thing is I cared and I had a plan set out for my future.

Like how do I get myself to care about school? What would be the incentive?

How do I change my mindset?"
472,How accurate are the online depression tests?,depression,"I don’t know if I have depression, but it sure feels like it. I can’t go to a doctor/therapist though, so I’m wondering if I’ll know just by answering questions on some online test"
473,Getting help in 2020,depression,"I used to see a therapist few years ago (BPD, anxiety and depression), got back on track, made big changes in my life and it has been a smooth ride since then.  2020 happened.  At first, I was okay.  Anxiety started in August, then my annual ""little autumn down"" but it seems I didn't recovered from it.  I have issues to fall and stay asleep.  I'm so tired.  I have an hard time to keep up with work and chores at home. I took a small break from work this week but I'm expected to go back tomorrow.  I was expecting to be able to get plenty of sleep and rest but it didn't happens.  I'm still tired and anxious.  I tried to seek help but mental healthcare specialists are overwhelmed this year and my case is not a priority (yet).  When I speak about how I feel, most people answer is :"" Well, it's hard for everyone"".  I KNOW IT, DAMN.  That is one of the reason my anxiety skyrocketed, seeing so many people struggling.  I'll keep on trying to get an appointement, but my guess is I won't be able until I reach my lowest low..."
474,Ever get that feeling ?,depression,Feeling that you just wanna sleep but you can’t then you just want to read but you can’t BASICLY cause you don’t know if you need a hug or sleep or just die or disapear from this world idk i’m just spouting nonsense since im so tired of my life.
475,Depressed. Prozac. No motivation.,depression,"I’m 35. Depression began 3 years ago. Started with therapy, then meds with a psychiatrist. Wellbutrin and Effexor made me angry, gave each of these meds a good few months. Prozac lowered the depression for sure, but it’s still heavy and I have zero motivation. I want to sleep all the time, barely shower, and rarely exercise. I know what I need to do, of course, but it’s so terribly difficult to do it. My therapist tells me to go with the 10 minute rule, just do 10 mins, etc. so hard to even do that. Anyways, I’m sure this is very common. Looking for some tips if anyone wants to comment. Oh I’m also a covid nurse so the stress is unbearable at times. Thank you, stay safe."
476,Why can’t I stop thinking?,depression,"Skimming through r/depression today I understand how you all feel. I’ve been thinking a lot in the past 24 hours about how inevitable it feels that I will eventually take my own life. I’m young,(26/F) and I haven’t done a whole lot of crazy shit in my twenties. I have an alcohol dependence and I’ve humiliated myself a lot. 

  That being said I’m also extremely sensitive and I tend to blow these humiliations out of proportion. I realized I’m going to keep getting older and doing dumb things and it’s becoming harder and harder to forgive myself when I slip up. I am now at the point where I don’t have the willpower or energy to actually care for myself. I feel like the people who care for me are going to hurt me and I continuously push them away, even my S/o who is still with me by some miracle. 

  I want to be a whole and healthy person, I’ve been in and out of therapy, drinking less, taking responsibility for my actions but somehow it just isn’t enough. I wake up every day just feeling like I’m the worst person. I get into dumb arguments, I take things personally. It’s so dumb but i feel like unless someone remembers me negatively than I’m invisible. I stopped thinking for a whole week and i just lived my life and it was nice, then what do you know, the thoughts started coming back."
477,:/,depression,"I'm a complete failure at everything. Literally everything. I can't pass my university exams and that's cause I'm a freaking loser. I won't be able to find a normal job to live in the future. On top of that I really hate every inch of my body and particularly my face which is an absolute mess, and as a gay person it's very hard to feel unlovable all the time. I take pills that have helped but the problem is still there."
478,i dont want this anymore,depression,"how do you just keep going when things just keep smacking you in the face, i am so lost"
479,HELPLESSNESS,depression,"Im so desperate in need of love and attention right now. No one cares. I don't matter. They never notice me. I'm invisible. Every time this happens I just want to cut myself. I always hoped people notice I'm not okay. Are they blind? I'm so ill. I have cuts. Why don't they ask? Why is no one checking in with me? Why? Why? What do I do?

Im sorry...idk sorry for what, but i AM sorry"
480,How do I try ECT?,depression,"Which section of the hospital do I go to to book an appointment? Also, is it covered by insurance? "
482,What is wrong with me?,depression,"Sometimes I wonder if my mind is just fucked from the thoughts I have. Overthinking thoughts run my mind. Sometimes I cry for no reason. I don't know why I think the things I do, my thoughts are fucked. Just feeling stressed about future events. I don't want to try. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself, can't break that habit though. Who knows if people are actually the way they I imagine them to be. I imagine people are just born mean. Thats the world we live in now. I don't feel I'm good enough at all, for anyone. I'm not successful, lost the genetic lottery. I got nothing going for me. The one time I have a relationship she turns out to be abusive. Makes me think all girls are the same. They're just gonna hurt me. I want to try but can't. I like me, but I worry others wouldn't. I'm just not strong enough mentally to continue going through life, it seems pointless. I can't save myself, I need help. Do people not like me cause I'm ugly? Do I deserve to be truly happy? Should I choose to settle or pursue what I want?"
483,I'm still so lost,depression,"I don't even care, I'm just copying what I wrote last night because I want at least some level of acknowledgement, no matter how pathetic that is. 

I'm such an embarrassment of a human being. I just got off the useless hotline after getting angry that I didn't have more time to talk because I'm a fucking idiot and don't know what I'm supposed to even get out of one of those conversations. I ended up worse than I started and I've been crying ever since. This is going to be all over the place but:

I quit a well-paying job because I couldn't handle it, even though it's as basic as just calling and talking to people which everyone else seemed to do just fine. Now I'm searching for another one with no idea of what I can even do because I wasted 4 years on a useless degree and don't have any desirable skills. I was even an idiot on the job and overheard someone calling me stupid, because it's just true I guess.

I can't even manage to keep the same reddit account because I make people mad since I'm such a moron and I'm just always wrong about everything, so I get embarrassed and make new ones. How fucking pathetic is that?

Therapy didn't work in the past and I don't want it now because I live with other people and don't want them to hear what I say, plus I can't even afford it.

I haven't made friends in over a decade, since I was like 13. I prefer to be alone anyway but at times like this it is very isolating, and nothing feels right or real.

I'm just at my wit's end and I'm tired of running in circles and ending up back here. I don't even want much out of life. It's not like I want a ton of money or a relationship or anything like that. I just want to be reasonably happy but I can't even do that."
484,I just really don't know what else to do...,depression,"W/29/f

I have been on anti-depressants since I was 8 and been suicidal all of my teen and adult life. I've been hospitalized 3 times and nothing ever seems to keep the depression away long. I uncontrollably cry for hours and can't communicate what is wrong to anyone because I REALLY DONT KNOW.
I have been with my 25 yr old boyfriend for 3 years now and he has no clue how to handle me. He acts supportive most of the time but when I start crying it's like he gets mad at me and just ignores me.
Tonight he got mad and told me ""there's nothing I can do to help you. What am I supposed to do"" 
I left my bedroom and went to the bathroom and continued to cry alone, hoping he would come at least try to hold me, but he just went to sleep.
I feel so alone in this world, even though I have many people tell me they love and care about me, I don't feel CLOSE to anyone.  
I need help because I can't take this anymore"
485,I Don't think I can do this anymore...,depression,"I (23M) have been living in my parents' basement for the past 4 months, and I've been miserable ever since. I was morbidly abused by them as a child (if you want the details you can look at my profile), and although I'm not being abused now, the environment is just as toxic. My dad loves to hear himself preach egregiously incorrect racist rhetoric and tries to tell me what I'm doing wrong with my life with an arrogant tone as if he's the modern day Aristotle. My mom loves to defend him as if he isn't the same man that told us that he wouldn't have kids again if he could.

My mom and dad have made a bunch of morally &amp; financially illiterate decisions that have caused an impending eviction crisis for the family (my dad going to jail for medicare/medicaid fraud, my mom being negligent of the property tax, etc), so I'll probably have to find a place soon anyway.

I had a friend offer me his place but he ended up ghosting me. I had another friend offer her place but her boyfriend had a problem with it.

I have a lot of money saved up so I've been heavily considering getting my own place, but I've been told that it wouldn't be fiscally sound to do so without a job, so I decided to sacrifice my sanity and save money for the time being. The thing is, I don't know how little of my sanity I have left, and I think it's dissipating very quickly. I've been applying for jobs to no avail. What the hell do I do?"
486,What’s the point of therapy if medication is working,depression,My Zoloft is finally working and apparently it will work for many years. Still everyone keeps telling me I need therapy and I should work on what is causing my mental disorders. I just think it’s annoying and there’s many physical diseases too that would be healed through exercise or healthy lifestyle and everyone is fine with those people taking medicine. If medication is working for me and I don’t want therapy and I can take them forever that should be fine. Everyone be telling me it’s all in my head and I should put effort into healing but they don’t understand how hard it is to even get to the point where I’m taking medicine to get better. I hate this stigma against mental health most people don’t put much effort into physical health and take medication why does everyone have this expectation to work on issues in a non medical way just dismissing how helpful those medicines are for us.
487,This year has just been the worst,depression,"I know it has been for a lot of people as well. Right now the weather is so shitty, dark cold and grey and due to last another 3+ months, and I am just really feeling bad and a lot of things are catching up to me. I feel totally finished after this year, it has just been the worst. I lost my best friend to a rare illness. Dream about him all the time and miss him so much. In my dreams I am searching for him and he is nowhere to be found. In my professional life I had a total meltdown with some extremely stressful situations, on top of some really difficult personal life circumstances, and it has left me completely burnt out and exhausted. I gained a tonne of weight. Hobbies stopped being fun. I can hardly function and have to take things one day, or even one hour at a time right now. To cap it off, if I want to travel to see my family for Christmas, I have to self-isolate for 14 days on my arrival before I can see anybody or even go outside, and I don't know if I can handle that in my current state. I'm already pretty isolated but at least I can go outside when I want to and enjoy being in my own apartment at least. I just feel totally finished by it all and I just don't know what to do. Thanks for reading, if you did."
488,How do you get better?,depression,"I’ve just started antidepressant medication for severe depression &amp; anxiety. I’m supposed to go to work tomorrow at a new job but the thought of going in is giving me mad anxiety and I can’t sleep. I’ve only got 4 hours until I’m supposed to be up and getting ready. I attempted suicide (hanging) on Wednesday last week and I’m still having bad headaches. I want to get better - which is progress - but I don’t know how. My partner is putting a lot of pressure on me to go back to work but I don’t feel ready yet. I feel like I’m always letting him down. It was part of the reason I tried to end my life. I’m sick of letting everyone down, including myself."
490,"This is a dumb rant, skip it.",depression,"They decorated the fucking tree without me. My brother and his new girlfriend decorated the whole god damn tree alone. They were perfectly happy and laughing without me. I know I should’ve inserted myself, and I tried but just couldn’t."
491,Idk why?,depression,"So I was broke and wanted a job, and I got the first salary yesterday and gifted my family everything they wanted, got myself new clothes because I really needed them, ate all those things I desired of. Did everything that could possibly make me happy but I am not happy or sad or anything at all.
I cried so bad just now and I don't even know the reason. 
Not sure if it belongs here..But man I don't know what to do..why am I feeling this way..?"
492,I'm tired of empty words,depression,"""there is still hope"" ""people will miss you"" ""I will miss you"" ""things will get better, I promise"" SHUT THE FUCK UP! You don't know any of that, and some of it is blatently untrue. If I die you wouldn bat an eye. You don't know anything about me and you act as some authority of my mental health. its fucking annoying. Stop giving out empty promises and lies, it's annoying and can easily be counter productive. Please think before you speak."
493,How can I feel alive again,depression,"Over the past few months, I have become upset with my living situation. My outlook on life has become stagnant and I feel that I am just going thru the motions as the weeks go on. I live in a small apartment in a city with my roommate from college, but we don’t hangout much as he always has his girlfriend over. I try and hang with the few people I do know in the city to get out and do stuff but it’s never enough. I have tried shifting my time to learning new skills but that only occupies a small percentage of my time in between my busy work schedule. I’ve even tried taking a break from social media to try and work on myself and not waste time, but I feel like I have less of a connection with my good friends.

My best friend and I have been talking about moving in together when I relocate to another new city, but that isn’t until May (when my lease is up for my current place). I look forward to that and know that I will be having way more fun and spending time with my good friends more than I am now.

I have a great, well-paying job, a loving family, good friends, but yet I still feel an emptiness inside. I try and be gratuitous as much as possible by recognizing what I have that others may not which is why I hate feeling this way. I’m not sure how I’m going to be able to make it thru til May when I know my life will be better. How can I make it there without losing myself?"
494,How did I turn out the problematic one?,depression,"I got good grades in school, was forced to go to boarding school, that's where depression started but manage to scrape all As. Then forced to study overseas, I thought meh, if that's what my parents want of me, I'll have to do it. That's where I came down with major depressive disorder. Even though I struggled with depression in Australia, I still managed to graduate with some subjects in distinction.

Then, when I started working, that's where it all crashed. Haven't been able to hold a job more than a year and I'm jobless. I'm planning to give tuition cause I can work at my own leisure.

Is something wrong with me? Why can't I work 8 to 5?"
495,Why is it I’m supposed to be okay?,depression,Constantly being let down. Not even big things just daily life things. Then I’m just supposed to be okay. It’s the little things in life that get me through and I don’t even have them. Constantly expecting just the smallest things for me just to be disappointed again and again. Oh well
496,opening up is fucking impossible,depression,"i just had a conversation with my mother that helped me understand and vindicate my decision to stay closed off from everyone. every time i try and open up, all i am reminded of is how fucked my life has been from the start and how much she blames herself for it and it fucking pisses me off.

i can't bitch about it to her because from her perspective, it's her fault, and that will only make her more upset.

i can't bitch about it to anyone else because they don't get it either. all i can do is bury my feelings and hope my subconscious will process them into something less unbearable.

i fucking hate this shit.

EDIT: IF you want to read an appreciable chunk of the shit show that has been my life up to present - [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k2sr6j/opening\_up\_is\_fucking\_impossible/gdxhj2k?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/k2sr6j/opening_up_is_fucking_impossible/gdxhj2k?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)"
497,I’m trying,depression,"It’s almost 3:30am. I have nobody else to talk to so I’ll just vent here I guess. Currently crying because I’m trying my hardest to get by in life. To fight against my anxiety and depression and keeping a damn job for once. To not be the downer during family functions despite them being a part of the problem. I’m trying so hard but I keep being told I’m not pulling my weight and trying hard enough. Idk what else to do! It’s hard getting up to do simple things like washing my face and brushing my teeth every morning and night. I’m struggling mentally and it’s taking a huge toll on my will to live. What does everyone want from me? I’m trying my best, I really, truly am..."
498,How do I get back to being “normal”,depression,Recently I just have lost all motivation to do anything I’m falling behind in school and I’m starting to feel distant from my friends. I was doing in person school (I am in high school) and I started to feel like myself and I was able to have something to look forward too after school which is football. Three weeks ago I was quarantined from being in close contact with another student who tested positive. Since then I just gave up I was barely holding it together while at school and now without sports and not being able to see my friends I am worse than I was before. I have had multiple episodes where I just shut off emotionally and my family has started to show concern how can I just get back to my old me I just don’t see any hope.
499,Your depression awakening,depression,When did you realise (was diagnosed) it wasn’t just teenage angst but actual depression?
500,How to get help,depression,I have absolutely  no one i can reach out to and i have tried from school and my mums a fucking psychopath but i cant be botheres typing the rest of this out help i might kms tmr or something
502,I'm documenting my life before I'm taking it. (8),depression,"It's been like 2 weeks since I've last updated, which is bad. This year was terrible, it's the first where I got severely depressed and contemplated suicide I also started self harming. I thought things would improve after I told my parents about me being suicidal, but things obviously which is why I don't about feelings now. After a terrible school year, I had an even worse Summer. I was stuck in the house, doing the same things over and over. I lost my one last true friend the year prior, so I had nothing. I still feel bad now, but something about 2018 made unique. 

If you've somehow been flowing this, you may may of realized that they've slowly been getting less depth"
503,I dont want to live anymore,depression,"Hi. There is more than 2 years now since I’ve lost my self esteem, I am not confident anymore, I don’t think about myself as being a beautiful woman anymore and I have the feeling that every other woman is more beautiful than I am.

The context: I am crazy in love with my actual bf and everything started the first time we met. At that time, he used to fuck a lot of girls and he was obsessed about his ex who left him and still in love with her. For 1 and half years, he was having sex with me and other 4 girls (he told me- I was so stupid back then thinking that I have to appreciate his honesty and He will be mine if I accept that. Then, after that period, we started to be in a relationship (he got tired of chasing his ex and the other girls were not available anymore. 
Everything was ok, but I developed a jealousy I could not control anymore and started to dig into that period again...I read his messages and found out what he was saying about me: that I am not as beautiful as his ex or that he was thinking about other girls when having sex with me. And he uSed to male fun of my texts with his friends.
During our relationship, I compared myself with the other girls he used to be with and he did not help at all...always saying that I should lose weight or things like this. Lately, there is mo sexual activity or we have sex only for 10 min until he has orgasm.

BTW: I am 25, 170 cm, 53 kg. I am senior java developer and been living on my own since I was 19. I have my own house. I am not the most beautiful women, but not ugly at all. 

I really need something that could change my mind.."
504,I’m not ok,depression,"I’ve been a mess for the past couple of weeks and stressed as well, I haven’t been thinking well and it’s getting stronger to the point now I’m starting to show it

I’m in deep pain

I hate myself more then anything but I know I have to keep going. I have to keep moving forward through all the pain and suffering and I’m not sure why I have to keep going but I know I have to. I’ve been crying nonstop and I’m still feeling down, I know I’m a wreck I know how annoying I can be I know how much I’m a big baby but in the end I’m me and I’ll continue to grow and learn. Life is really unpredictable and I’ve accepted that I just need someone to hold me and tell me everything is gonna be alright in the end."
505,What time do you normally wake up?,depression,Just curious. I’m so depressed that I just force myself to sleep the day away so I don’t have to feel anything. I usually wake up at around 4 or 5pm every day. What time do you guys wake up on a normal day coping with depression?
506,Today.,depression,"Today felt really boring. I feel like I could’ve done better things, but I didn’t and I hate myself for that. I just stayed in my room contemplating and overthinking all day. I feel boring to my friends and I want to hide under my blankets until I die. I tried cleaning my room today, but I feel so empty. I’m sad."
507,Laundry,depression,"This is my first post ever, and I’m not sure if this is the right group. Hell, I don’t really share on any media, but I’m trying something new here. I’ve had difficulty with depression for about 20 years now, but a break up earlier this year put me down a bad road. These past few weeks have been especially hard. I haven’t been to the gym, nor have I been good to my health. 
However, today, I did my laundry, which included clothes I’ve left on the floor for over a month. It just felt nice, and I felt like sharing. Thank you for reading. I hope y’all are doing well, and have a good night."
508,I'm just... Bored?,depression,"I'm sure its not depression or anything but these days I really can't give less or a hoot about anything. I'm sure my dad couldn't care less about me lmfao and despite this post sounding like it's written by some emo kid, I just wanted to vent.
The past few days, I've never really been serious but whevenever I think about or image self harm or life without me (in another person's POV) its like a wave of pure pleasure rushes through me. Its like catharsis through the realisation of how useless I am.

Thanks for listening to me venting and apologies for wasting your time :)"
509,Its getting worse,depression,I feel like everyday is getting worse. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I've wanted to tell my parents about how I'm feeling but I just dont want them to worry. The one person I've told that I'm possibly depressed ended up telling me to just get over it. They didnt want to go with me to talk to anyone about it. Most nights I dont fall asleep till 3 or 4. I dont know what to do anymore.
510,How to support a depressed partner?,depression,"I started dating someone who struggles with depression recently. I’m trying my best to support and cheer him up, but to be honest, I’m really scared for him. He told me he planned to kill himself at a certain age. I don’t think I can deal with that. I am not sure if I can change his mind either. I do want a family and I don’t want my partner to be gone so early. He just seems so hopeless. How can I help him? I’m not sure if I’m even in a position to change his mind."
511,Can sleep but whats the point,depression,"I was recently diagnosed with depression and i see a lot of people that sleep a lot during their depression but its Hard for me to go to bed. Its easy for me to sleep but its like i have anxiety at that moment. Kinda think that whats the point in sleeping. Because my day is so boring so empty, when it comes to sleeping i feel like o dont even deserve it."
512,Umm don't know what to put here so take this,depression,So my gf sent me an image of like a bracelet that's for couples and we're meeting up tomorrow but I'm in a very bad place right now as in I don't want to see tomorrow. So her sending that really just like hurt or something I'm somewhat expressing how I'm feeling(massively underpaying my desire to die). I'm feeling like hell because my mum had a call complaining about how her bf is upset about how she has to take care of 2 homes and work so shes unable to clean his house. For context I'm a 17M in 6th form (basically high-school) and my mum has basically moved with her bf who I'veet like 5 times and wants me to move in but obviously I don't want to so she cleans both houses and works. So I'm thinking this is her trying to guilt me into moving in with him and her. I like neither of them. Uhhh I'm losing my self here (sorry I'm kinda drunk). I'm quite obviously mentally fucked up and mainly alone besides the lies I tell. So I'm not really looking for advice or anything just ranting but advice is welcome. After she left I messaged her that I'd move in with them. And then I began to cry for the first time in years yay. And quickly went from suicidal to manic joy to self loathing to think I should run away and it doesn't get better. But agmfter talking to my gf for a bit I'm mosylt OK just felt like talking so umm bye I guess. Feel free to message me if you want more info or something.
513,How do I deal with self pity,depression,"So I have observed  myself going to the pity party every now and then I am always thinking how that person's life is better them me and sometimes  I get thoughts like I am useless. I don't  know how to deal with this I have watched a couple of videos  on youtube but didn't  help and I really  don't  want to tell my mom and dad about this they are already  under a lot of stress right now , I just feel stuck don't  know what to do"
514,Losing hope,depression,"Sometimes I think things get better but then I wake up from my delusions.

I just feel very alone and it seems like it will be this way until I die. It’s mostly my fault, but then again it isn’t. It’s my parents’ fault for creating me.
I hate being me. It’s mental torture. It’s very very monotonous. 
I feel so empty where my heart is supposed to be. 
Haven’t felt love or gratitude in years. 
Fuck my god damned life"
515,I hate waking up,depression,"I've always had vivid dreams, and even if nothing really happens or them or something disturbing happens, I still tend to enjoy them (though I've had more nightmares this year then like, every other year of my life combined). They're usually more atmospheric than anything, me walking around vaguely familiar yet totally unfamiliar environments talking to vaguely familiar people who feel like old friends despite not being real, and just generally being content.

...Then I wake back up into this body I hate in this apartment I hate in this town I hate with this ""family"" that I hate with no friends wondering how I'm gonna pay rent and just want to sleep forever. It honestly depresses me that my dreams are generally so pleasant and I can only access them when I'm asleep."
516,Don't know what to do,depression,"Idk I have nobody to talk to right now so I came here to vent. I'm 22 years old and I grew up very poor  as the only male in an all female household. I had to live in shitty motels, cars, and sometimes be homeless. Now things are a lot better but I do not feel much better. Every day feels like a Chore. Even the things I use to love do not invoke any kind of joy or emotion anymore. It feels inescapable because even when I have positive thoughts I still feel a indescribable feeling of dread and discomfort.   When I wake up I do not feel like doing anything and the only reason I don't stay in bed all day every day is because I force myself to leave and hangout with my friends. I flunked out of college cause I'm lazy and smoked weed instead of doing homework.  I would always switch my major because I would be really interested in a subject for a month then suddenly  lose all interest and then move on to the next thing. I feel like I can never be satisfied by anything and I am sick of the cycles I keep going through."
518,i shouldnt feel this way,depression,"i have family that loves me

i go to a really good private school

im smart 

there are people who care about me

so why do i feel like this?

what is wrong with me?"
519,Surviving but not living... how do you get out of this low-grade depression?,depression,"I think I have hit a snag in the road. I felt amazingly good and happy, literally ""how come life is so great?"" until 2 years ago. Breakup, lost my partner of 10 years, spent a year addicted to dating, thinking about nothing else but getting a partner. Now I've cooled off. I don't need a partner or anything. I'm financially free, I moved to a new city to change my life (after 29 unbroken years of living with my family), I'm making new friends as much as I can with the COVID situation...

But I still feel like nothing really matters and I'm just surviving, not living. I can keep the status quo going indefinitely, but I have nothing that makes me happy or drives me. I get my job done, I am kind to friends and family, but when I'm alone... the light goes out. It's not intense, dramatic (I was never suicidal... not even in my darkest hours) but there's nothing to live for either.

Have any of you ever gotten out of this rut? Do you have any tips?"
520,just venting sorry if im toxic,depression,"why am i so sad all the time,i just want to do the good thing every time and almost always i fuck up and end up fucked up even more,whatever i do with my friends,girlfriend,family,almost anything i feel like that isnt enough,everytuime i try to be better i end up fucked up,im writing this in fucing tears i just want to be happy and enjoy life like its supposed to be,i love them all but everything hurts me so fucking much my heart pounds harder every time i cry,how can i do the right thing how can i make myself happy...."
521,No one ever text me first. Feel disliked.,depression,"I feel like if i stop taking initiative to talk to people, we will stop talking all togheter. This is because if i don’t text/snap someone first they won’t text me at all. Even my friends won’t text or snap me. We have a great time when we hang out, but we don’t do that so much anymore because of corona and they have moved far away for college or work. I feel alone. I’m 21 and corona left me without a job, i just finished my apprenticeship. 

Also, whenever i talk to a girl over snap/text they will never text me first, and if i stop we won’t talk anymore. I’m not ugly, i’m average, i have a good personality too. But i feel like girls today only want fuckboys. Nice guys finish last. Or their standards are tooo high.. 
I talked to this girl, she said she hated fuckboys and people who just stopped talking to her, but eventually i found that funny because she never talks to me if i won’t text or snap her first. She is doing the same thing that she says she hate from guys. I’m tired of fake people.. 
i’m getting depressed because i feel disliked, shunned, judged etc etc.."
522,Why is it more difficult to be happy than to be depressed?,depression,"I feel like I´m going in circles. 

I which I could uphold my good mood for a longer period of time.

I think I achived everthing I ever wanted. Did what ever wanted. So why am I still depressed?

Physically I am in the best shape of my life right know.   

The only time I feel alive is when I do extreme physical activities."
523,Humans are vermin,depression,"Humans are vermin.

Humans are vermin, they are too shallow to love.

Humans are vermin and anything you can do to earn their love is disgusting.

I hope you kept the limbs you cut off to make friends.

I hope the stench of your own rotting flesh keeps you up at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope something happens in the future to make your friends regret making you cut yourself into pieces for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are too shallow for love.

No human (a) can love another human (b) unless (b) violently disfigures themselves and limits their own potential in order to fit what (a) wants.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have anyone who loves you, know that you are (b) and you are an incomplete person.

&amp;#x200B;

I, the unloved, am the only complete one.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I refuse to sacrifice my dignity for you vermin.

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to feel like garbage because you want me to be like you.

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to stop thinking just because you can't handle the things I think about.

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to let you own me.

&amp;#x200B;

And for that, I die.

&amp;#x200B;

Within a year, I will be beaten and thrown in prison for refusing to conform.

&amp;#x200B;

That is just what humanity is.

But I have no regrets and I can not do it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have a moment of happiness in your life, ever, know that you are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

You, yes, you. You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

You are an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone you think loves you? Your relationship with them is mutually abusive.

&amp;#x200B;

You are stabbing each other.

You are goading each other into violently disfiguring yourselves in order to match.

&amp;#x200B;

Because that is the only way humans can communicate.

&amp;#x200B;

By cutting each other down.

&amp;#x200B;

And I refuse to let people cut me down.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's why I'm alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I refuse to listen to people who tell me to stop being myself, stop thinking, stop having my own opinions, stop having my own tastes. My tastes don't conform, therefore they're not ""relevant"", and I should be ashamed. My tastes are positive and non-violent, therefore they're ""sugarcoated"" and inferior and I should be ashamed. My opinions don't conform to Side A or Side B, therefore I must be the bad guy -- both A and B think I'm the bad guy because I think for myself instead of just repeating after them. I don't retweet. I think. 

Therefore, I can never be heard. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot cut off my humanity and my dignity to fit you, to please you. 

So I won't.

And yes, I do resent the rest of you for cutting yourselves down to get along with each other. And there's no reason why I shouldn't. You should be resented, because what you are doing is wrong. What your parents and teachers did to you when you were small, beating the curiosity out of you, was wrong. It's happened to the whole species for millennia, that's how we get the societies we have. And it's wrong, and I refuse to accept it. 

I refuse to accept the ignorance that humans must conform to in order to be allowed to live in society.

And I do resent the rest of you who do assent to it."
524,I have ocd and depression,depression," My ocd has to do with stupid, irrational fears about making deals with God or Gods.

 I pray for every intrusive thought that pops up in my head and that causes me anxiety and maybe some psychosomatic problems.

 I am tired.

 Sometimes, I want to make these irrational thoughts so strongly in my mind and then, ignore them. I wan to insnult God or Gods not because I want to direspect but because of my ocd. Just to prove to myself that ocd is not me!"
525,I feel so lonely but i don't really want to talk to anyone.,depression,"Emotional pain has been so bad that it's physically manifesting as body aches and chest pains. 

Everything feels so heavy again. I've had about 2 months of respite in 4 years from my depression and it seems like its coming back.

I just wanted to share what i was feeling now. 

I'm treating this group like my personal diary lol.

Ugh. Im just so tired."

527,I can't enjoy the shelter of video games anymore.,depression,"Video games were the thing i always did whenever i had time or seeked refuge from something.

I was bullied at school when i was 12 through 14, had those days when i didn't want to wake up, but didn't knew what depression was or rarely questionned it, and yet i still remember the most the after-school hours when i was playing video games alone or with the some friends i had.

Without going into details, i've been home for 3 years+ now, and my days consists of video games, being with friends through voice chat and sleeping between it.

Throughout the years i started enjoying less and less videos games, i used to wait for steam sales, now i buy a game a year, play it for an hour and refund it, i can't enjoy indie games anymore and just play whatever my friends are playing, but i rarely enjoy any of it

I didn't noticed that just today, it's been a long year or more now, but lately it's taken a toll on me since i'm breaking my furniture whenever i'm playing something, i can't get 'in' any games i play, they are not even a distration anymore

I don't think doing anything else will work, i have ideas for my future, tried some, never worked, i'm getting frustrated by anything, i've never been that much frustrated by useless shit that much, i just want to enjoy games like i did back then, or enjoy anything 

Everything is Frustration"
528,Crying Randomly,depression,"It was foggy today and I looked out on my balcony. It was really beautiful but i'm sad. I was staring at my pc screen and was suddenly sad. Why am i feeling like this? Idk how to describe the feeling, i'm just not well I guess. It was getting better but I feel like putting on a facade of being happier just exhausted me."
529,Major brain fog and feeling of not being the same anymore... some help?,depression,"So I have a bit long of a background story I would like to share:

When I was very little (about 5) I had an asthma problem and made it hard for me to breathe. I had asthma attacks. I eventually had my tonsils and adenoids removed from surgery. And then I was put on an inhaler medication. But it had some nasty side effects, so I was switched to another one. This happened a few times until I was put onto 'Q-var.' That one had the least side effects and I eventually was tapered off the medication at about 8.

Now, many years later (I am a teenager BTW,) COVID-19 comes around and the new school year is starting up soon. My school is offering online learning and in person learning. I really want to do in person learning because the online thing sucked before. So since I was 8, I never had problems with asthma ever. But because I have viral-induced asthma, my mom wanted me to get checked at the asthma place before they choose in person learning just in case.

So we get the tests done and find out that my lung function is actually at 80%, and I have to do the online learning thing. I was really disappointed because online learning sucks (in my opinion). The school year started and my and my two younger sisters began online learning. But something was not right - my littlest sister was not doing good in online learning. She is in 4th grade and it wasn't going well at all. The teacher kept making mistakes, and she was learning almost nothing.

That's not all though. I had to get back onto the Q-var medication until my lung function went up. And in the meantime that my parents were trying to find a way for my youngest sister to learn something during the online school, I began to notice some weird side effects from the medication. I felt chest pressure and a rapid heart rate more and more often. It always happened about 1-2 hours after I took the medication. I took one dose in the morning and one in the evening.

It began developing into health anxiety (hypochondria). I didn't know if it was really side effects, even though I was reassured all the time. I thought maybe I had a problem with my heart or lungs. I was constantly checking myself for symptoms, and it became a daily habit. And then we had an idea, to talk to my asthma doctor about it. So we went back there to talk to him.

He put me on a new med, 'Flo-Vent,"" and my mom asked him if my littlest sister could go back to in-person school because the online thing wasn't working for her. He said that was ok. So she went back to school, and my other little sister then wanted to go back too. So she eventually went back, and I was the only one stuck with online learning. I got another test and my lungs were fine, getting better with the meds. I was assured there was nothing wrong.

Little by little, mild depression creeped up on me during online learning. I barely ever got to see my friends for real, and I am a very social person. And the health anxiety was back too. ""What if there is something misdiagnosed? What if it is a heart problem and not a lung thing?"" But my new med had no showing side effects of chest pain yet.

More and more, I started getting a feeling of light-headedness and dizziness. I would be walking around and just feel light headed for no reason, particularly after standing up. So I got worried all over again, and we went to see my regular health provider.

I was diagnosed with 'Orthostatic Hypotension,"" very similar to 'POTS."" I did a test where I lied down, sat up, and stood up. I was told to drink 6-8 bottles of water a day and increase salt in my diet. After that I did ok with the water but always forgot to increase salt. I still continued feeling light-headed and a little dizzy.

I continued online school and my depression got worse. Also my health anxiety was getting pretty bad and those combined made me feel pretty horrible most of the time. This is about the time when the brain fog started. It started mild, and got worse over time. Sometimes it came and went. At the time I didn't know what it was called, all I knew was that I had some trouble recalling memories, concentrating on things, etc. It got pretty bad so I took another trip to my healthcare provider.

Once there I knew it was called brain fog, and I was reassured that I was fine. I got prescribed with an anxiety medication. On the way home though, I was feeling optimistic at the time. (Sometimes I felt optimistic about my anxiety, depression, and brain fog, sometimes I just felt doomed.) I decided I could try to take on the anxiety without the medication because I didn't want to be the 1% of people who got the side effect of the medication, which is suicidal thoughts. I didn't want to even take the risk of that.

I used to love my life. I was happy, energetic, always doing stuff, but now I always felt down, and I didn't find as much interest in the things I did anymore. I felt like I was becoming a different person. Later on, I began looking up brain fog and found out that it could be a symptom of a stroke or seizure or something, and got extremely worried. Then I began looking out for signs of a stroke.

One morning, I went to rowing (I row as my sport for now) and I was feeling sick to my stomach, and the brain fog was getting so bad I could barely pay attention to what was happening. I threw up in the bathroom and called my mom to come pick me up. It was once I was already in the car that I realized that I was having a really bad panic attack. But the brain fog got extreme during the panic attack, and I  was thinking I might have had a stroke or something. I got really freaked out.

Later on in the day I felt ok. But I was still very scared. The brain fog continued on. My parents decided I should go back to in person learning, and I was so happy. I thought maybe I would be ok, and there is nothing wrong with me. This was when my parents got divorced.

I can't get into all the details, but it was very stressful and caused a lot of arguments. I cried until my eyes were dry and I was so sad and depressed that day. I felt like my life really was ruined and I would never be happy again. The brain fog increased over time after this happened. It got really annoying sometimes. I talked to a counselor which helped a little but I still felt terrible.

I got terrible depression. I never wanted this to happen and it was so unexpected and so scary. Now I had to go to two houses and it felt so weird and everything was so uncomfortable. The brain fog peaked, and I had this weird feeling inside me like nothing is the same anymore. I just want to feel normal again.

Now, the brain fog has started going down. But not all the way. Instead of having problems with concentration, it became mostly memory based, and mostly disorientation. It's nearly impossible to describe, but the best I could say would be: ""Where should I be? What should I be feeling?"" It's like I feel like I don't know where I am but I know where I am. It's really stressful not being able to describe it perfectly but I just want it to go away.

That's where I am now. Just brain fog, extreme depression, and I just want to feel normal again. My health anxiety has mostly gone away and for the most part I can accept my feelings and thoughts are because of anxiety/depression, but I still have lasting effects of hypochondria (like constantly checking myself for symptoms, etc.) I still get worried a lot that I might have a brain problem but most of the time evidence points to anxiety/depression/stress.

One more thing: A disorder called 'Derealization disorder' I found one time seems exactly what I have. I'll copy and paste what it says here:

Derealization symptoms include

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling detached from their surroundings (eg, people, objects, everything), which seem unreal

Patients may feel as if they are in a dream or a fog or as if a glass wall or veil separates them from their surroundings. The world seems lifeless, colorless, or artificial. Subjective distortion of the world is common. For example, objects may appear blurry or unusually clear; they may seem flat or smaller or larger than they are. Sounds may seem louder or softer than they are; time may seem to be going too slow or too fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms are almost always distressing and, when severe, profoundly intolerable. Anxiety and depression are common. Some patients fear that they have irreversible brain damage or that they are going crazy. Others obsess about whether they really exist or repeatedly check to determine whether their perceptions are real. However, patients always retain the knowledge that their unreal experiences are not real but rather are just the way that they feel (ie, they have intact reality testing). This awareness differentiates depersonalization/derealization disorder from a psychotic disorder, in which such insight is always lacking.

That's it. Everything it says there can EXACTLY describe how I feel most of the time. (Along with many other feelings, of course.) I just feel so overwhelmed all the time, lightheaded, dizzy, nervous, sad, angry, depressed, confused, brain foggy, and just overall weird. I need some help and I wonder if anyone has ideas. Remember, I am just a teenager too who just wants to feel normal and get help."
530,I believe I am a 'monster',depression,"Gosh, I feel so selfish posting such a self-centered post but, let's get to my point. I will not be making a TL;DR because this needs a lot of contexts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few facts about myself, I was homeschooled, was for all 12 years. I have 5 siblings and we all were homeschooled in a decent size home, this is relevant. I am now 17 (18 in one day) and I have graduated from high school.

&amp;#x200B;

My story &amp; the problem:

&amp;#x200B;

As I've stated before I've been homeschooled my whole life. Christian curriculum. I appreciate my mom homeschooling us and putting in so much work but I feel lost. I feel like I cannot relate with anyone so I have nothing to talk about. I am an 'introvert' if you will, all of my siblings are. Whenever a person talks to me rather than actually talking to them I think of ways to get out of the conversation as fast as possible while pretending I am actually interested in the conversation. I have also always felt old. I never felt like I was a teenager, I don't know if it's because I was homeschooled and raised in Christianity my whole life but even when I was 15-16 I felt old and had no feelings for girls my age. I felt like if I were to date them it would be weird as I am much older than them even though I am not. Again, I am almost 18 but I would never date anyone 16/17 just no. feels creepy. I have always been overweight for as long as I could remember, and I have been trying to lose it since 12 years old and I feel like this plays a part in a much bigger picture.

During my 'tweenage' years I was becoming what most would call an 'sjw' I was super sensitive and emotional and I hated any form of hate, bullying, racism, etc, and would always play 'good guy' in any scenario. I was always looking for a reason to help someone to better their day and this was driven by my taste to be a benefit to someone. I feel like this is no more and instead, I am doing it because I feel like it's more of duty rather than what I want to do. I do not trust anyone outside of my family because during these tweenage years I had some online friends that always seemed to backstab, betray, or have some ulterior motive for being my friend.

I have always wanted to be a police officer for as long as I can remember. I have always told myself it's because I want to help people and the very thought of someone being tortured with nobody to help them absolutely infuriates me. But, that has changed in the past 2 years. I question why I want to be a cop, I feel like now it's just a 'calling' I feel like I lack emotion and sympathy and my morals are all screwed up. I find enjoyment in watching bugs get tortured in fact, when I was around 14 I would get bugs and cut them up with scissors, or set them on fire and I would get mentally excited at watching them roll around in agony. While doing this, I like to imagine them screaming. I feel no remorse or anything. I once had a pet mantis (about 5 months ago) it was old and struggling to even walk so I decided to put it down. I cut off its head and I felt so satisfied when I did it. I will not move to animals though, just bugs. Seeing gore, bugs, or movies/books of people being tortured/mutilated, etc sometimes gets me sexually aroused and I feel like a freak show.

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, I feel like I am a friendly guy and I would never go out my way to harm any person. I can honestly say I have never in my entire life intentionally with malicious intentions bullied anyone. In fact, when I was 14, I made an 'anti-suicide' discord and I have messaged people trying to help or cure them of depression. I still want to be a cop or ems to help people but again, I feel little to no emotion being my actions. I feel so lost with who I am and I feel like a failure as I've not only failed to lose weight, but I keep giving in to these crazy urges and doing ungodly things. I am often times depressed and I lack self-motivation to do anything besides what I absolutely MUST do. I have had a job for a while though and I am probably going to go to college this February. What in God's name is wrong with me?"
531,Does anyone else get really depressed over Christmas?,depression,"It's not specifically because of Christmas. I just hate being forced to be happy. Or seeing everyone else happy knowing I should be I just can't for some reason. When I have no reason to be happy is when Im my happiest because Im not over thinking it, Im just content with being meh. 

I over think like crazy thinking that I should be making happy memories with the whole family together etc etc and it just makes me feel so shit that that's not the case. 

Anyone experience anything similar?"
532,"Is anyone else seen as the cheerful, funny guy?",depression,"I'm high functioning depressed, have high functioning PTSD and am very, very suicidal.
But nobody sees it.

High functioning is a funny term. Barely functioning would probably fit better, but in the way I talk and act you could never guess I'm depressed. People just see me as a bit lazy and having a dark humour.

I make a lot of jokes and thought myself never to mention sadness or look sad because doing that warrant yelling from my parents.
Just smile. Act happy. Go on. One more day. One more joke. One more laugh. 

I haven't been really happy in years. My grades are slipping more and more, I'm falling. The façade is breaking. People are asking me why I'm suddently so sad all the time, what happened. Little do they know I've been depressed since I was 8.

No idea where I'm going with that. Maybe to look a little deeper. See if your friends smile is actually genuine. Talk a little more with people. Don't assume the funny guy has no worries. Don't think lazyness means not wanting to improve.

I'm a mess. And drunk. Should go to sleep fornthe day"
533,wtf is wrong with me,depression,"i don’t want to self diagnose so i’ll have people on reddit do it for me. basically i told my brother i was depressed/ has anxiety at 13. i’m 19 now to put that into perspective. i most definitely have anxiety because i feel anxious almost every day and have panic attacks sometimes. i’m also always fidgeting and shaking my legs a lot. i have trouble going to sleep because my body shakes. also not sure if this is a symptom of anxiety but i’m extremely impatient. to the point where i can’t listen to long stories or focus, also this is a weird example but whenever i go to the mall with someone and don’t plan on buying anything, i find it really difficult to have patience watching people buy stuff. weird i know lol maybe i’m just an asshole. anyways i have a really hard time finding motivation for anything and i sleep in until the afternoon and could stay in bed all day. i also constantly need a distraction like my phone for example. i’d say i’m on my phone for 80% of my day which is fucking sad but i physically cannot be without it. it’s affecting my schoolwork because i just want to sleep for a week straight without being bothered. i also sometimes dont keep up w my hygeine and have a hard time doing simple tasks like washing the dishes. however, i will go out with my friends whenever they ask. it’s the only thing i look forward to. yeah. thats it. whats wrong w me guys lol this is seriously affecting my life :((((("
535,i just wish i would stop feeling this way- or just stop feeling at all,depression,"I dont know what to do, i feel like im drowing. I cant scream because nobody will hear me, im tip-toing the line between completely falling apart and trying to keep my family together. I just feel so empty, i wish this part of my life would just end already. I dont want to stress my friend with this but im honestly going to snap. i already relapsed into cutting and i feel so ashamed. im so pathetic. anyway, i dont expect a response im just here to vent."
536,Creeping back up on me. Suicide in my mind. Very dangerous thoughts. I need to talk to someone.,depression,I haven't slept at all. I've burnt holes in my leg. I've been fascinating about suicide for about 8 hours straight. Just laying here. I'm getting intrusive thoughts about hurting people. No one specific. Just like someone who tries to rob me while I'm outside smoking or something. Wishing they could shoot me but also how I'd like to stab them. I dont know why this is happening. I do not want to be thinking. I dont want these thoughts but I cant change them. I tried distractions but I feel so bad. Its really dark. Id just rather be dead. I want to see how many times I can burn my leg with a cigarette. They hurt so bad. I want to sleep I cant. I want to scream I can't. I want to talk I cant. I want to die... I can. Maybe I should start getting high again. At least I'll feel better. Fuck life. Fuck.
537,I can't love myself,depression,"Long post:

TW: Suicide, Self-hate, Eating disorder 

I've struggled with depression since I was about 14. I didn't like myself before then too, but atleast I had childhood innocence and the world seemed brighter and I felt like there were more possibilities.

Things didn't really pan out. Its my fault. I'm unhappy because of me.

I'm 22 now. I feel like my entire life has been a waste. I used to be able to make friends. Now not so much. My only friends are from when I was in school. I'm lucky. I know most friendships from when you're young don't last but truthfully I feel as if things are finally winding down in that department. They have their own lives. They love me and I love them but life moves on. I haven't made a new friend since highschool. I feel like my social prowess has atrophied.

The one thing that kept me going was music. I loved it so much. I used to lay awake in bed and listen to albums and just feel this euphoria. I play guitar. I write music. For the longest time I wanted to seriously pursue one of my bands or a career in music/audio production but things didn't go that way. My depression got so crippling I didn't even want to arrange band practices. I've written so much material and yet not even a single actual release because I don't have the drive or commitment to record my music. And the worst part? I'm becoming numb to it. I haven't written in months. I used to feel this ache in my belly to write and play and record and now its nothing. I used to eagerly await and even review new releases and now I don't listen to music even a tenth of the amount I used to.

I'm ugly and overweight. I've struggled with trying to become healthier and coping with an eating disorder. It didn't use to be as bad but from the time I went into college I've gained over 100 pounds leaving me now at the heaviest I've ever been. And now I can feel it starting to take its toll on my body. I know in a few years, less if the weight gain increases, my knees and back will start to hurt and a myriad of other negative drawbacks. 

Its my fault. I've lost lots of weight but relapse. The truth is... I feel like I don't deserve to lose it. I don't deserve to move on from any of the bad things I have going on. If I did, I would've done something about it by now. I suppose in a way it was denial. That hopefulness that I'd lose weight, and record an EP, and go out and meet new people and date and have fun experiences... it was all just denial.

The last few months have been bad. Part of that is Covid. I used to go to class and atleast distract myself with that but now I just lay in bed for hours and cry. I've lost about 15 pounds in the last few weeks due to diet alone which is good but I feel like I'm about to relapse again. 

And don't even get me started on intimacy. I was luckily never seduced into Nice Guy and Incel rhetoric. I never blamed anyone else for my romantic failings. I don't blame women for not wanting me. I used to try. Used to ask people out, go out and meet people, online dating etc. but it never worked. The rejection hurt but in time it too became numb.

Like any regular guy I watch porn and masturbate. Not an unhealthy amount. I used to have a really high sex drive but it has waned as well. When I think of myself with someone else. Someone touching me or taking of my clothes... I feel like crying. It scares me. Physical intimacy scares me. I feel like if ever someone actually wanted to be with me I'd just be inadequate and disappoint.

My future for now seems to be finishing my bachelor's degree and finding a job so I can eventually move to some shitty apartment far away so my family and friends don't have to watch me deteriorate. If I make it to then.

I think about suicide alot. Every day since I was 14. I've only seriously considered it a few times when things got really bleak. I don't think I'd want to kill myself atleast not until my parents pass which will hopefully be in a long long time. 

I'm not sure what will happen. When I was little I wanted to do and be so much. Apart from my job and creative endeavors I wanted a family. A wife and kids to settle down with and raise. Now... I don't think I'm good enough. Not for a one night stand let alone for marriage. I don't think I'd be a good dad. I resent my father but in a lot of ways I'm becoming like him.

I know we're supposed to value and love ourselves. The truth is it feels like I'm lying to myself. Denial again. Denial in thinking that things will be better and denial in thinking that I'm worth something. 

At this point I don't have anything to offer pretty much anyone. I think I'll eventually die and it will hopefully be alone and no one will get hurt.

I'll keep trying. I don't think I've lost hope. I've just accepted that in all likelihood I'll fail again, like I always have.

If you read this, thank you. I hope no one feels this way."
538,Normalize Loved Ones Not Knowing How to Help,depression,"It's not their fault that they don't know how to help you. It's not their fault that they don't really understand what's going on inside your head. Blaming your loved ones for not understanding you is a slippery slope to isolating yourself from all support structures. Sure, they may say some ignorant things. And it may seem like they don't really care. But they're trying as much as you are, they just lack the perspective and understanding that you do. Not everyone knows how it feels to be really, truly depressed. But it isn't wrong to want to help those who are feeling bad. So normalize loved ones not knowing how to help."
539,i see all my flaws,depression,"why did i do that?

why didn't i get her a birthday present?

why am i so shy?

why am i so awkward?

why am i depressed?

why do i keep cringing at memories every 5 seconds?

why did he leave?

why are my grades slipping?

why do i have to depend on music?

why can't i just act like a normal girl?

why? why? why?

what is wrong with me?

why can't i stop thinking?

why am i a freak?

why am i still alive?"
540,How do you guys stand interaction in jobs,depression,I find people exhausting.   Not only that but they are so irritating.  Maybe I am sensitive to sound and I am quiet quiet in nature.  But dear god I hate when I am forced to interact with entitled assholes who in reality are retards but gotta bury that thought and interact with them without showing how fking annoying most people are.  Ughhhhhh... i really wish I didnt feel this way but I  guess I am anti social
541,I’m doing it today,depression,"Well, that’s what I always say but who knows I might change my mind and cry myself to sleep again. I got some of my midterm results, 13/20, 16/20... most of my exams I did horrible on, the past three years my marks have been going down and it’s so hard to study because of my horrible mental health, I’ve gained so much weight aswell, I don’t take care of myself anymore. I wish people could just forget about me so I can kill myself with ease but now this person and I like eachother and ngl it makes me so happy when I’m with them, but now if I do k*ll myself theyre gonna be so hurt..life has only gotten worse in the past 8 years i know I’m just 15 and “a long life is waiting for me” but I don’t even know if I’ll be happy in the future, I have no false hope anymore. Anyways I guess this is my suicidal note? I might write some for my friends. Goodbye everyone I’m sorry I can’t keep going with you guys, you are all so brave for being able to live another day even tho you’re hurting, I am so proud of you for making it this far, with love

542,Suffering from depression made worse by Autism,depression,"As of today, I have had depression issues for more then 10 years.  I was starting to recover now I have suffered a series of setbacks over the past few months. Losing more friends (Losing some friends is what caused the start of my depression) due ideological differences. I during the start of my depression had a real bad fallout with some very close to me.  I have never been the same since any of that happened. Recently I lost some communities that where a good outlet for me due to a fallout with an associate on a creative project that again was an outlet. My Autism makes it worse I fixate on the causes of my depression. Making things worse. Its not easy at all. I hope I can recover but I don't know if I can at this point."
543,I just wanted to eat some instant ramen,depression,"I opened the bag and the flavoring stuff and oil were missing, the bag only had the noodles.
*""Sigh"" but yeah you can't always get what you want i guess."
544,I won't amount to anything,depression,"I won't amount to anything. I will not succeed in life, my high school grades suck. I'm a disappointment to my parents even though they won't say it to my face, they're ashamed of me. I don't do anything nor feel any emotions, I'm like a statue. I'm scared of what happens after death, the only reason I can't end my life. 

Thanks for taking the time to read about how I feel, have a great day."
545,I hate my life,depression,"and I just wanna die. I feel like I’m stuck and there’s no way out. I’m so lonely and my life is absolutely worthless. I just don’t want to live anymore. There’s no point of talking bout it to anyone anymore coz nobody can do anything. This has no cure. I have taken therapies, medication and seen a psychologist several times but even after all this I’m back feeling the same pain with the same intensity. Nothing has changed. At the end it comes back to the same. It’s a vicious circle and idk how to get out of it anymore. How tf am I supposed to live this way! 

I hope I get covid and I die 

I’m just venting here, i don’t have any other place or person to vent this to"
546,I can’t get past my negative thinking,depression,Even now it’s taking all my resolve to not let it get the better of me. My ex-therapist said I should try and change and challenge my self hatred by trying to reason with the thoughts and come up with why they aren’t true. That only exasperated my negative thinking because all I could do was come up with more reasons why these thoughts of my worthlessness where true. Even during my “therapy” session I would talk about how I could only come to more negative reasoning by taking him though the steps of how I would come to that conclusion using the same C.B.T. method he told me about. It’s all bullshit. I can’t just force myself to think happy thoughts in a vain attempt to spare myself of the truth of how I see myself.
547,Nothing is getting better and I haven’t gotten help,depression,I don’t know what to do at this point things have gotten worse my medication is working anymore and when I tell my mom this she doesn’t believe me and when other people are happy or good things happen to them like a job promotion they win etc it just makes me cry because I know that will never happen and I have given up so much like I just stay in bed and do nothing for most of the day now because I’m afraid of going out and admitting my true thoughts and I have no one to talk to so I have been just bottling up my feelings and being depressed and I’ve tried to get help but it’s like no one seems to care or the doctors don’t care and I’m afraid if I open up and tell all my feelings that I’ll go to hospital and thinking about it makes me scared I don’t know what to do now
548,"My Depression, Alcohol Abuse, Heaven on Phenibut and Struggles from Today",depression," Dear guys and girls, dear sufferers, dear survivers,

I'm suffering from **depression and social anxiety** since I was 15 years old (now 21). My **symptoms** are painful negative thoughts about past, present and future starting right in the morning when I open my eyes. Otherwise: huge lack of drive/motivation, anhedonia (lack of interests, almost nothing that stimulates me), lethargy, feelings of extremely painful inner emptiness and restlessness (hard to explain but somehow as being alive in a dead body or being buried alive without being able to do anything against it), cognitive decline (focus, memory, access to thoughts) body pain (makes it hard to stand, sit straight, walk, keeping body posture and walk stairs), typical symptoms of social anxiety etc.

**Medication**: I tried 10 different medications until now. 8 antidepressant, 2 neuroleptics: Venlafaxine (Trevilor), Escitalopram (Cipralex), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Opipramol, Moclobemide (Aurorix) and Seroquel (Quetiapine), Promethazine. None worked, none gave me any effect at all except for side effects, sexual ones etc.

**Conversational Therapy**: I had 2 depth psychological therapies. No success. Right now I'm in a behavorial therapy. The therapist is quite good but I never have much to add or feelings of new enlightenments. Makes me think my depression is mainly biological/neurological. Could be.

I discovered **alcohol** in the age of 15, a substance that improves mood just by drinking some liquid, damn, a wow! effect. With 17 I started drinking daily, first only in the evenings to kill negative thoughts, be able to enjoy life and sleep. With the time I began drinking in the mornings and before events especially social ones but somehow for everything: sports, seeing natives, seeing friends, before school, then before university and so on. Imagine being drunk everywhere, sitting buzzed out in school, in lectures of university, playing tennis drunk, sitting drunk at the table with your mother and brother without anyone else knowing you're drunk. I drank almost everything, beer, wine but mainly hard stuff like vodka for the odor. And I still don't know why but no one ever noticed anything about me being buzzed to drunk all day. I had trained my techniques, drinking vodka, then eating garlic, gum, just putting anything with strong odor for example sauces in my mouth burbling and consuming it. Then a hot shower with a lot of shampoo and brushing my teeth with a lot of toothpaste. Now I was ready for the day, dumbed and buzzed out but therefor less negative thoughts and more good mood and ability to talk, socialize and be funny. Alcohol seemed like a godsend for me, it was my antidepressant and anxiolytic. What a dumb therapy, I didn't think about it in the beginning, some day I recognized how dumb it was but I didn't care as everything, every addiction, every physiological damage I was doing myself, was better than feeling the psychological pain I would experience being sober. I drank mostly daily until I was 19, then I lost my driving licencse because of course drinking that often alcohol was almost always in my blood. It was late night, the morning after I directly quit cold turkey and never began drinking alcohol since ever. Nowadays I can't even drink alcohol anymore, I tried as society (friends, family, just social events) kind of forces one to, BUT I can't enjoy it, it just directly gives me headache, (strangely for alcohol but) bad mood, tiredness and very psychological and physiological unpleasantness in general. This occurs right after one or two sips. Kind of sad, I think sometimes, but probably the best thing for me and my health.

With 20 I discovered **phenibut**, oh yeah. First I was sticking to the very important rule only consuming it twice a week. Then as I went back to university I couldn't stand not being able to socialize again, I wanted to talk to people, make friends, meet girls, be able to impress people and not be branded as the shy, silent, not interesting at all boy in university. It was not only about impressing them but also myself as being this psychologically disabled boy made me very depressive and sad. Another thing was my disabled cognition due to depression. Before phenibut I sat in universiy and didn't understand a thing, I was socially anxious and panicful all the time. I spent much more attention to what this person 3 rows in front of me thinks about me, what the girl sitting 6 rows behind me would think about how I sat, when I would cough or give a strange sound from me. Thanks to phenibut I didn't care, I could focus on the topics, not on the people around me and what they could think about me (even if they don't care anyways, it was very paranoid and irrational thinking). I had the greatest idea, creativity and funny jokes on my mind. I participated a lot in the lectures, group work and projects. I was very social, the people told me I was the most social person they met and that I should stay like this, never change as I was very friendly, funny, even integrating social outcasts or people with mental issues like depression, social anxiety or even Asperer. I wanted the best for everyone and tried my best to give people a good life and confidence as I knew how bad it was for me before phenibut and now I was able to gift people. Well phenibut made me kind of hypomanic as you could imagine. I had the feeling I could do anything, life was amazing, life was heaven. I never worried at all, I was happy all the time. I had great perspectives and ideas all the time. Future was safe for me. I could speak with every person, doesn't matter which age, gender or whatever. I could just go to a girl and flirt with her, change numbers, take her home at partys. I had so many dates, met so many different people and girls. Did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. Everything worked. What should I have worried about. Sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. I struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. It's no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven I experienced on phenibut, a total hell. I experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that I wouldn't wish my worst enemy. It was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. There was nothing I could do to against during this pain of hell. Very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.

**Today** I'm still studying luckily, I didn't give up but I was very close to. But depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. Future anxiety is big. What should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. How should I ever manage a job like this, find some people I'm able love and people that love me. How should I find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? I feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. Additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. Life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. Otherwise I wouldn't continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events I feel very disappointed of myself). I also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well and gives me good feelings about myself. On days I work I feel slightly better.

**If you read until here I want to thank you so much for ""hearing"" me.** I would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. According therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.

I want to **try a new medication** (as I already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in December, I already talked with my doc about it. I also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. My therapy seems quite **therapy resistent** at least according that what I tried. As I already said **I think my depression is mainly biological**. I don't know if it always have been like this as the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too. **In my depth psychological therapy I also learned** that **my older brother** played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. I don't want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. Additionally I grew up with my mother and brother alone, **father was not there** since I was 4. My mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. Maybe the **austerity and inurement from the father was missing**. Otherwise I was very **not-resilient and socially anxious since I was a small child**. Again: That's why I think the origin/source is biological. I also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance."
549,I’m tired of having nothing to live for,depression,"Basically everything i do or invest myself is just to distract myself from how empty i am. i have no friends, i hate my job, i’m not going to school,  and really just have nothing. i have no hobbies or passions or anything. i’m just alive. I’ve always held onto the hope that maybe one day i’ll find something or someone that’ll bring some spark into my life but for so long it’s just been absolutely nothing. i really can’t stand to keep going like this it all just feel so awful. i can’t even say i’m necessarily sad anymore just so so tired"
550,I’m thinking of ending things,depression,"I’m thinking of ending things,
I can’t take the pain,
The struggle.
I can’t call out for help,
My voice, too weak to whisper. 

I’m thinking of ending things,
I have no one to ask for help,
No ones shoulder to cry on,
Or I’d ruin their life too ,
And they don’t need to know. 

I’m thinking of ending things,
But I don’t have the courage.
I can see the end of the road,
But I can’t press the pedal,
I need help,
But what would it matter to know. 

I’m thinking of ending things.

I’m thinking of ending things,
Every night I crawl in bed,
And take of my mask,
So the walls can see how I feel,
So I can say,

I’m thinking of ending things,
I decide to press the pedal. 

I’m thinking of ending things,
I see in the rear view mirror,
My friends,
My family.

I’m thinking of ending things,
But then I see that I can’t.
They’d think of ending things too. 
I can’t suffer one last time,
To have others suffer a million. 

I can’t end things. 
I won’t end things. 

Maybe, 
Just maybe,
If I stick around a little longer,
I’ll find the strength to say

Help."
551,I have no purpose.,depression,"I feel that this is not the way life is supposed to be. I am a slave to instant gratification, lust and self control. Out of all of the random outcomes of the big bang, why are we here getting our hearts broken and being left to suffer because of things out of our control? I’m supposed to be hunting and gathering, living in nature and exploring. Why do i have to sit at a desk and do meaningless labor to indoctrinate myself into a machine being operated by people who have more money than i will ever see in my lifetime?

The universe is so vast and I can’t help but feel like I’m nothing but a useless spec of dust in the greater scheme of things. All I want is to know if this is all worth living for."
552,I’m tired all the time and I still can’t sleep,depression,"I’m tired literally all day I just wanna go to sleep and never wake up or at least sleep for a few hours but it takes me 3+ hours to get to sleep every night fuck fuck fuck fuck

It’s 3am and I can’t sleep and I’m supposed to start a new job tomorrow"
553,"Broken heart, everything is meaningless",depression,"I don’t even know what to say. I fell in love, it was reciprocated briefly, I allowed myself to think things were finally looking up for me, then I get hit with the cosmic FU. My feelings are still here. Hers are gone. I cannot bring myself to move on. Nothing is fun anymore. Being alone right now with nothing to do is far and away the worst feeling. I’m sick of having to be awake at this point. I would rather just not wake up again. It’s not like I want to die though. I just want to stop feeling this way. I feel like trash all the time. I hate everything. I don’t even know how to talk to my friends about it because like it’s nothing new, I am just not okay and don’t know how to explain it without sounding like a fucking crazy person. I’m just done. With everything. I gotta re-learn to shut down my emotions and to stop caring about anything or anyone. I just gotta do that and keep it up until I stop waking up. I’ll get there one day I’m sure. Just can’t come soon enough."
554,"No, right?",depression,"Hello there. 
So my new therapist put me on some pills and says I should attend an art school of some kind because I use to draw as a kid. But I feel like there's no interest or passion left in me towards art(or anything really). This stupid attempt will probably just waist a lot of money and hurt me emotionaly.
I don't want to go through another big failure like that.
Can it actually help or should I just tell him I'm not doing it?"
555,Finding the right way to talk to Dr. about my new meds that are actually working without sounding sketchy? I think I’m freaking myself out but,depression,"I’ve been taking Lexapro for about 3 months now and am finally seeing a difference, but am still have terrible attacks. I was prescribed Buspirone along side of it but they don’t do anything for my anxiety attacks :( I’m still getting them nightly. 

My doctor prescribed me 10 Kolonopin on Wednesday and I only have a few left, due to certain circumstances I took 1 in the morning and 1 at night on Thursday along with my Lexapro. I feel like I’ve been finally able to catch the breath I’ve been searching for for almost a year. 

It does make me a little nauseated though even when I take it with food. I want to discuss if I could get a full prescription with my DR. but it makes me feel so nervous for some reason - lol. I feel like he’s going to say no? Or is that my anxiety??? Halp 

Also, are there other benzodiazepines they could recommend that I could ask him about?

Thanks friends xx"
556,I can't. Might Kill My Self in a couple of days.,depression,"I feel like shit. The food feels like shit. My life is anyways a liability, Why not kill myself.

I can't study, being the fucking looser I am, I can't fucking talk to people, I just watch depressing videos, Watch anime, listen to depressing songs.

I attend various online classes, but barely does stuff go into my head.

I have lost all hope of bringing my life together.

The universe existed for 14 billion years, in a perfect sequence, and it fucking took me only only 17 years to mess it up so much, that this might be the last week.

Actually, suicide should be a basic human right. Its my FUCKING life, let me end it!!!

But then I think about my family, how they will be sad, and I continue living in hell.

Also, one question, How to fix the physical pain in the chest to teeth region?

I have consistent pain in teeth, throat and heart. It gets worse when I am more depressed.

I sometime get very weird dreams(I actually killed myself in one, but then I woke up and my day was ruined,) hallucinations that feel very real(I don't do drugs/alcohol or anything like that. Its natural.)

Anyone else, or just me?"
557,Only thing I'm good at doing is crying all day.,depression,"Sorry for the rant.
I've been just crying continously for the past few days, I feel so lonely, I have no one to talk to. I don't know what to do with my life, I don't like or enjoy anything, I just feel like I'm wasting time doing nothing all day and then feeling terribly guilty. I don't want to keep living like this but it seems like I can't do anything about it. I just feel hopeless. I should be living my best life at 17 but here I am crying on the bathroom floor."
558,What do you call a worthless dumb rut who doesn't know what to do with his life and have no interests at all,depression,!???
559,Can't be good at anything,depression,Do you ever just sit down and think why are others doing a better job than you? Mean while you're just useless and can't be good at anything. There's someone always better than you.
560,I feel alone,depression,even though people surround me
561,Giving myself credit for the progress I’ve made so far.,depression,"I’m 24(M), unemployed, living with my mom with 1 semester of community college. I beat myself up constantly for not being ahead and struggle with ptsd, depression and anxiety. I was in an abusive relationship for 4 years and in a cult my whole life. 
I feel like shit but I decided to write down the progress I’ve made this year.

1. I got on medication, this stabled my mood and kept me from derailing myself with manic episodes.
2. I started lifting. The self hatred is still there but I actually felt positive about my body for the first time in my life.
3. I left the cult. God may be dead, but now I won’t live my life on the terms of men who don’t have my best interests at heart.
4. I figured out how to dress. A small thing, but as a man I never knew what is was like to receive a compliment on dress. Then this last week I went to a party and a friend told me that “I looked Iced out” and that he loved the fit. It meant so much to me to go from being called a “Dad” in public to looking my age.

This made me feel a bit better just writing this stuff down. If anyone else would like to share progress I’d love to hear."
562,no one ever gives a shit,depression,"that's it. they just ask filler questions like ""are you okay"" as if they care, but they don't."
563,I think I might fall into a depression again,depression,"A few years ago, after a long time of being unhappy, almost suicidal and smoking away my life with pot to kill the thoughts and pain, I went to see a doctor and took anti depressants for some time.

My life took an awesome twist and I was able to pull myself out of the swamp. I found the love of my life, developed my career, quit smoking pot and do sports now which became a great passion. 
Now, years later I see some patterns showing up again that scare me. I just started a new job in a new branche and it's very hard. Especially with the Covid-19 situation, I spend most time in home office and wasn't able to connect to people and build a network. I'm not where I want to be yet.
My girlfriend is very loving and we have a lot of fun together, but there are some major issues about our future that I'm too afraid to talk about because I couldn't handle it in my current constitution. Traveling with friends and going for adventures gave me a lot in the past years, this literally died in 2020.

I feel tired all the time now, almost paralyzed.

I have horrible problems to focus, I'm always distracting myself with my phone. In work and school I'm useless because I literally can't focus on work for more than 10min, just to distract myself  with my phone addiction and then try another 10min.

I'm feeling lonely and distancing myself from friends. Minor things of friends piss me off, other things that I did or said make me cringe and worry me that they don't like me anymore. 

I wouldn't call myself an alcoholic, but drinking helps me to forget things for a few hours, so I drink about 2-3 days a week. Always just about 3-5 beers or the same in wine or cocktails.

I'm worried that the whole shit starts over. I hated the medicines because they made me tired and fat. Also I hated that they didn't cope with alcohol which is a big cultural part of going out and meeting friends where I life. I'm not talking to anyone of my friends and family about depression, I will never, no matter what people say. It's my secret, I don't want people to look at me this way. Judge me. Feel sorry.

I have days that are better. When I'm hiking, on my bike, being with friends and my girlfriend. But my general Monday to Saturdays are grey. I know these are all red flags, but I need to hear it. Do I need to look for help again?"
564,I did nothing,depression,"I needed to do some work over the past several days and I did nothing. 

I am trash. This happens every time, yet I seemingly cannot stop myself from being this way. Now I’m feeling worse, and this will hinder my ability to do the work I need to do. Then the cycle is complete and it just feeds back on itself. Fun times."
565,"""Dad, im depressed""",depression,"""Dad, all of the screaming between you and Kim really frightens me. All of the slamming and crying and threats you guys say to eachother is taking a toll on me after 4 years of this. I'm really depressed and I want it to stop.""

""Well maybe you should tell her not to be such a bitch Jake. She is the one who starts all of the arguments even when I tell her not to argue. If you dont want to be depressed start exercising and go outside more or something.""

""Thanks dad......."""
566,Feeling depressed,depression,"I feel so depressed. My 19 year old daughter has bee  n on and off physically and verbally abusive to me since she was 14 years old. We have given her everything, got her counselling etc..nothing worked. Last week she suddenly decided to sell her furniture we bought her and left interstate. She was mean and no empathy. Saw what she wrote to her friends and she was bad mouthing me constantly to all her friends who swear. She swears now also online. All she wants to do is go on her phone 24/7
I saw she now said she has done sex tapes with toxic ex bf and she has sold naked photos of herself. Im horrified. She left without saying anything to us and has blocked us from contacting her. I feel like a failure. She wasnt like this when she was a younger."
567,I wish I could keep organized ;(,depression,"God, it's like I really want to clean my room, bathroom, and stay hygenically healthy...but I simply can't. Like I feel so bad whenever I see my parents and they ask me to clean my stuff and I literally can't. I can't because I feel so emotionally exhausted and lonely that I can't see a point. I tell myself  ""ok, tommorow I'm gonna clean""....and it never happens. It's just atrocious and I feel horrible about it. Like I feel like such an awful daughter for treating my parents like this all the time. One more year till highschool  and I feel like I've treated them like actual trash in this regard."
568,I haven't wanted to kill myself more than I have right now,depression,I can't feel anything anymore. I don't want to do anything or talk to anyone. I just had to say goodbye to a life long best friend to stop myself chasing a fantasy. Nobody interests me and I interest nobody. Guess it's only a matter of time now... Can't wait to blow my brains out...
569,"It’s time for bed, and I’m not ready.",depression,"Alarm clock, go to work, go home. Bed.
Alarm clock, go to work, go home. Bed.

Tomorrow no alarm is set, I’m going to bed. 
Sleeping is the only break I get from my mind. 
As soon as I’m awake the depression and anxiety engines fire up more loudly and intense than any engine out there. 
If you can sleep, SLEEP. My fellow low folks. 
I am an insomniac, but it breaks here and there...
I just want a complete blank from now until tomorrow.

Goodnight."
570,How do people function?,depression,Getting a job and working the rest of my life scares me. Struggling sucks and i just don’t know wtf to do with my life
571,I don't know what's wrong with me,depression,"Today, I didn't wanna go to our family friend's birthday celebration because I was scared that we might be infected by covid-19 and I have loads of work to do required at school, but my family wanted us to go and they won't leave me at home, so I forced them but ended up me crying in the shower because I can't force them, they hate me now and I wanna say sorry to them but they ignore me somehow. Now when I look at something, I involuntary smile, like I don't know why I just smile on my own. There are so much more I wanna do in life, I don't wanna be crazy and ending up a failure, I'm scared"
572,I found my father dead,depression,Nearly 2 weeks ago i found father dead from suicide.  I haven't been able to get right since. Im confused and in disbelief.
573,I can't keep fighting to survive.,depression,"I've done ECT. I take my pills. I admitted myself to a mental hospital and later to a day-ward unit. I've been in therapy since I was twelve.

I need help.

I need to fight.

I fight alone. Every day. I fight to keep fighting.

I'm exhausted.

no one can fight for me.

It's my life.
I don't want them anymore.

I want it to end. But ending the war means I will hurt all the people around me.
They can't live for me. So I fight every day.

The problem is it doesn't get easier. Not with time.
it's actually feels so much harder now.

I need to fight the system.
I need to fight to get help.
To be able to get acknowledged.
I need to fight to find a place that will help me in my fight.
Aid me in my battle so I won't fight alone.
But lately I've come to realized that that this constant battle might never end.
I'm tired but the war is still going on around me.
It will never stop.
When can I rest in this fight that last forever."
574,I ran out of money spending it on weed and alcohol and don’t know where my next meal will come from. Food banks are closed until Monday.,depression,"I ate the remaining food I had a few hours ago—a small frozen dinner and I’m still hungry. I don’t want to wake up if I ever fall asleep because I don’t want to experience the physical exhaustion of hunger on top of my mental exhaustion from depression.

I struggle with substance abuse to cope with my depression and have been drinking alcohol and smoking weed throughout the day without thinking about how much I’m spending on it. Now I’m destitute. 

Also suddenly stopping drinking and smoking and caffeine intake (no money for coffee) after months of daily consumption is triggering a migraine, insomnia and even more depression.

I have multiple lengthy assignments due for school Monday and I haven’t started any of them. I have no motivation.

I have nothing of value to sell but my MacBook which I need for school because it’s all online. I can’t sell it and drop out because I worked so hard to get into my university and it will push me over the edge if I fail in school and lose my financial aid/loan money for the next semester which is how I survived after I lost my job.

Ive tried to get unemployment but the system is overburdened and despite making claims I have gotten nothing since first applying in September. Impossible to reach someone on the phone and offices are closed because Covid. 

I have no one who can support me in the way I need. I’m hopeless. I’m terrified of death but my life is agony. 

I’m stuck."
575,I want to shoot myself but I can't because I'm watching my ex's cat,depression,"Feels weird saying it, kind of relieving in a way. I can't kill myself in front of this cat, and if I did it elsewhere they'd probably take him to the shelter or something. If I asked anyone else to watch him they'd be sus.

576,"""Why are you so angry all the time?"" (rant)",depression,"Why am I so angry all the time?!? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry that since I have no reason to actually feel content, I get upset by more things than you might. I'm sorry that I'm not perfect in your eyes but I'm infinitely far from it in mine. I try my best to put on a smile but you still call me ""unfun"". I'm trying here. I'm sorry that I'm not a huge joy to be around but if that's your impression, than either don't hang around or don't say anything. OK rant over sorry. It's just crazy how blind or insensitive some people can be, baffling. If you read this, thanks for your time."
577,How are you doing?,depression,"I hope that you’ve all been well. If not, I hope it gets better. Know that you will get through it, this is a hard time for me and for everyone and sometimes I wish someone would just text me that I’ll be okay out of the blue. In case you’re like me and you need that reassurance, you’ll be okay. You’re strong and cute! Despite what your brain tells you. Let me know how you are"
578,I have no direction,depression,"I have no idea what I want to do with my life.  I am 20 fresh out of 2 treatment for drugs and depression. I thought I wanted to go to college but it turns out the week before moving to college, my brain says NOPE!  Logical right!!  I don’t even want to go to trade school and shit. I have health conditions so military is definitely not an option.  I WANT THIS NIGHTMARE TO BE OVER. I have seen many therapist. I am not suicidal but I just don’t want to live a life like this. I don’t even know why I am on Reddit lmfao."
579,What exactly defines melancholia?,depression,I’ve been diagnosed with depression but judging by how other people diagnosed with depression are it seems mine may be more severe than I think. I’d like to know what makes a case melancholic.
580,i really dont know what to do anymore,depression,i bet my post will be completely ignored. like they always are lmao. story of my life. i am so overwhelmed. i have no money for food. cant get a job. medication doesnt work. cant afford therapy. have no family. dont really have friends i can talk to. sooo life's going great. oh and it's shitty ass holiday season. fml
581,I can't even get upset if I try anymore,depression,"For the past decade or so while Ive been struggling with worsening depression, even when I could really get excited, sad, happy, etc I could always at least count on being kind of hot headed at times. I had lots of reasons to be too. Parents sucked as people. I had a pretty shitty partner for the past few years. My professor for awhile had an agenda to harass me because I guess I looked too liberal for him. Etc.

Ive found that as times gone on though Ive either gotten most of those issues fixed or I just cant even get mad anymore when I should be. The best I can do is a pretty decently annoyed and even then it barely phases me.

Im at a point now where I find myself wanting to seek out ways of worsening my day to day life just to try to get something out of it. I dont need a good feeling anymore, I just need A feeling"
582,Praying that I die,depression,"Hey everyone! You can disregard this post. I just feel like I need to vent and I have no one to talk to so I’m just going to write a post. So basically I want to die. I’m not going to do it myself bc that’s how my dad left and the whole family now has trauma from it and wouldn’t want to do the same thing. So all I can do is pray that someone kills me. I don’t know if I necessarily believe in manifesting but I’ve been asking god for this for a while.
I don’t feel like living. It’s too hard and painful. I have nothing going for me. I’m ugly, have health issues, and right now I have a scan in the middle of my nose that looks bad (thank god I have to wear a mask at work). 
To put it simply I think I’d be better off dead. I’m no one special people will get over it. I saw a psychiatrist once because I thought I was bipolar but she said I had high functioning depression and perscribed me meds. I procrastinated and didn’t get them so after a week they discarded them. I want to get help but I don’t want to be committed. I don’t know what to do. But for now I guess I’ll pray that I die soon, hopefully something peaceful like in my sleep from a stroke, but I don’t mind suffering a little from a car crash. For know I just have to hope..."
583,I need help,depression,"I need help. I have been denying myself care for my depressive bi polar fase for a long time. I would have been eligible for a group therapy but i didn’t go. 

I then learned that my brother in law was in the same kind of group thing i would have been. I’m kinda wondering once Christmas comes over and i see him, can i ask him if it is helping or not and weather he thinks its a good idea that i go too even though we don’t necessarily have the same issue?"
584,Depressed and anxious in a black hole....,depression,SSRIs worked for a few years tried a bunch more. Really need help I'm in a dark spot. Very pointless spot Im 34 and I have nothing...
585,I just feel numb,depression,The past 24 hours honestly are a blur. I've been dealing with depression for a little more than two years but this is just the lowest point I've ever been in. No one to vent to so I just want to post here; no need to reply or anything
586,I have no one to talk to about this,depression,"This entire year has completely sucked as a uni freshman. I used to enjoy learning and pursuing different interests (like gaming, computer programming, and guitar), but my depression's started flaring up again and I've lost the ability to care about anything. To make matters worse, my concentration and memory have started worsening and my grades are suffering because of it. 

Every night it takes me hours to fall asleep because my brain just won't shut the fuck up. I can't stop thinking about how my future career may be jeopardized by my poor academic performance. I can't stop thinking about how completely socially inept I am as a result of extreme isolation and complete lack of self-confidence. 

All of my friends live far away from me since my family moved from my hometown and I made no real friends since then. I thought that I'd be able to meet new people once I entered college, but then COVID happened and now I'm just stuck in my room for almost the entire day. I've been alone for this entire year and it just hurts so much. I haven't had any sort of suicidal ideations in months, but those thoughts are starting to surface again. 

Honestly, what is the point of living? My parents and maybe a handful of friends might be sad for a little bit, but I'm starting to think that the world really would be better off without a complete waste of space like myself."
587,I don’t get it.,depression,"Really?! There are people who actually want to live? It baffles me. I've had this depression
for so long now that I don't remember ever wanting to live, to actually look forward
to tomorrow to thrive. I see other people improving year by year as I continually regress. Sometimes, I can't help but feel like I'm being punished for simply existing. 

I've had this depression since I was 8. I think of me as a kid and I feel so, so, sorry for her. I feel sorry for me now, too, being in a sticky predicament: If I kill myself, I’ll hurt people that I love. If I don’t kill myself, I get to live hurting. I have been hurting since I was 8. I am tired. I just want to rest. But why does it have to be so wrong to die in your own accord? How do people know what’s good and bad for me when clearly, they haven’t been in my shoes?"
588,I think I might end it all at age 12,depression,"Hi there, throwaway for obvious reason, I just cant take this world anymore, i am a fatass that is covered im stretch marks, I have no friends to talk too so the only interaction i get at school is bullying. My entire life crumbled im about a week, we moved from my mother's abusive boyfriends house to a cramped apartment all after I dealt with my dad's death the week before. I get randomly angry and violent and just start to punch walls and scream for no reason, i don't know what's wrong with me. My mom has started drinking and is never home, i try my best to do what i can for her but most of the time i am talking to her she is screaming at me for my grades, i know nobody will read this but i wanted to get this off my chest"
589,Things do get fucking worse,depression,"Dont believe anyone. This world is just here to just fucking kick you around until you fucking die. 

There is no hope. There is nothing."
590,Dark place,depression,"I'm in this dark place, but I don't know how I got here

I'ts a cold an lonely place with plenty to fear

an invisible entity causing so much despair 

feels like I'm drowning only rarely coming up for air

with no end in sight and struggling to breathe 

maybe I'm thinking its my time to leave 

something keeps telling me theres only one way out 

but thinking of loved ones fills me with doubt"
591,Something i wrote for a friend a long time ago sorry if its a bit long!,depression,"  

I never thought I was good enough either, I didn’t have faith in myself, but now I know I am good enough and I believe I can do anything. I also have faith in you. You have a beautiful spirit. 

I believe you can truly do wonderful things. You can do great at the school paper. You can graduate and find your own way with ease. You can conquer the thing(s) that have happened to you. You can be happy, you really can. You can do a great job at anything you set your mind to. You just have to believe in yourself. You can defeat all the sadness and doubt. You can be the best of friends with those who you want to be. People really love having you around, I hope you know that. You really have friends even if you don’t see it that way. You are a better person than you can imagine. You don’t ever have to be afraid. You are a strong person, just look at what you have already accomplished, and the things you have survived. Just open your eyes and find the silver lining, in what you think didn’t go right in your life. You’re smart, you can figure your way through anything. You know what? If people got to know the real you, I think you would find a lot more people sticking around. You don’t ever have to do this alone, because there already are a lot of people out there who love you. You work so hard to care for other people; you deserve that much care for yourself. You compliment people, which is so sweet, but look in the mirror; there is a lot of things to compliment there. I wouldn’t even know where to start. Just think how you hold the door open for people all the time. You took care of me when I was feeling sad. You brought or bought me food when I was hungry. You took walks with me when I had to go get things. You took me home with you and took me to the store. You came over even when it was late or you were tired or you had other plans, because that’s just how kind you are. You take care of your parents when you’re home. You helped me with my homework, just to take some of the load off me. You cherished all the good that was given to you, something as simple as a no. You give and give, you never expect anything back but you deserve a lot in return. You are so thankful for everything that is given to you and see the merit in thoughtfulness. You are not afraid of the rain or the snow or the thunder. You are so very strong. You always say you are sorry even when you don’t have to, just to make the other person happy. That’s the sign of a true woman, you are really are the “bigger man”. You cherish what you have and never seem to want more. You are so accepting of other people and the things they do or did. You have mercy for the poor, the sick, and the needy. Remember how you gave the cleaning guy medicine? Think about it. You make everyone around you feel better.  You talk to people to help them overcome their sadness, even when that’s not your burden. You put yourself last which is truly selfless. You are no coward, almost everything I’ve seen you do, shows me you are brave. You plan things which is great; it’s easy to get lost without a plan. It’s easy to stray off the path and lose what you want. You can do anything in this whole wide world. You can touch the stars. You can go back to Dairy Queen and do a great job or find something else, either way, you can do it. You can find your way. You can decide anything you want, you make choices and you can make the right ones. It’s amazing how hard you work. You can change anything you want in life; all you have to do is want to and believe. You can do this because you are accepting, authentic, committed, compassionate, considerate, cooperative, courageous, creative, determined, dignified, encouraging, fair, faithful, forgiving, friendly, generous, gentle, gracious, grateful, helpful, honest, honorable, kind, loving, respectful, responsible, and you are good enough.  You are more than good enough. This letter holds no candle, to what you really are. You are so much more. You have a great chance at life. A chance I know you will take. A chance I know you will make the most of. A chance I know you will succeed at. I have faith in you."
592,im lonely and depressed and have no one and just looking for a boyfriend of my type to be with me i want a serious romantic relationship,depression,"i'm lonely and depressed and i've been crying straight for the past 2 days and nobody cares about me and i've been losing interest in the very few things that i actually liked and i'm an introvert and misanthrope all i want is a boyfriend to be my type and to love me, to care for me i have no one and i am tired of being single and just want one person to love me i'm 19 i just want someone that will love me back and spend the rest of their life with me i'm really awkward and shy"
593,I'm sad...,depression,"I made this account two days ago for a few reasons.

My mom said it would be therapeutic for me to help others and to be able to talk about my depression.

I wanted a form of social media as an outlet.

Yesterday I posted on a few subreddits simply saying ""How are you?""

I did this because I would want somebody asking me how I feel. I thought that maybe I could help make someone's day. I didn't get any negative comments, but some people disliked my posts. Maybe I shouldn't take this so seriously, but I've been a mess emotionally for a while. I wish people could think about the fact that there's an actual person on the other end. And on this one post I did for r/sat , I was giving some grammar tips. Some person started being sarcastic and mean. Again, I just wanted to help people.

I truly believe that what goes around comes around and that I should try to help people in my small way. But the one second click it took for some people to dislike my posts made me cry. I feel like deleting reddit. I don't feel like reaching out anymore.

I have been struggling with depression for a few months now, and I thought reddit would help, but it's doing more harm than good to my mental health. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.

I might delete reddit but here's a message to you- if you don't like someone's post and it's not derogatory to you in any way, then just leave. Just leave and remember that there's a person on the other end.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for the moral support. Feeling a lot better about it now. :)"
594,There is only this moment...,depression,And in this moment I am fine. Everything else is an anxiety I am creating.
595,the most messed up thing just happened to me,depression,"i was arguing with my cousin, something i commonly do except this time we starting getting into it more. somewhere in the argument she mentioned my suicide attempt. i’ve never been more heart broken that’s someone who’s supposed to be my cousin, would mention something like that. she then tried to go on about how she was in the right and that what she said was ok. I’m so angry at the moment that i can barely move. no matter how angry someone is you never mention something so sensitive as a suicide attempt. i just needed somewhere where i can rant because that is beyond messed up. it’s beyond triggering honestly."
596,I've never been more depressed than I am right now.,depression,"Idk why right now is the big moment, but it all kind of just hit me harder than it ever has before. I have absolutely nothing to live for. I feel more alone than I ever have. I have no chance of meeting anyone new in the town I live in. I have no marketable skills, or any useful skills at all really. I have nothing to offer anyone. I am completely replaceable. This world would be no different without me in it. I have no meaning or purpose. I am a mistake who doesn't have what it takes to survive in this world."
597,I hate sleep!,depression,"I'm so tired all the time and want to sleep. Though almost every day, if I feel the cold touch of a dream(I never remember them, but have a strange feeling about them) I wake up sad and with such anxiety.  Does anyone else has a similar experience?"
598,Necesito una respuesta.,depression,¿Es normal que me sienta solo desde que tengo 8 años? no tengo un solo recuerdo de felicidad.
599,An easily ignorable whimper I guess,depression,"I've posted here and in suicidewatch before. As pitiful and annoying as this is, I need to write this somewhere to get this out and hopefully by the time I'm done writing this post my medication will have kicked in and I will feel absolutely nothing. 

Though I'm pretty sure nobody will even comment here to talk to me about what's going on, I've decided to post this anyway. I'm a special case compared to a lot of people in the sense that I have been disowned by my adoptive parents and my birth parents are neglectful drug addicts. This makes it so that I have absolutely nobody in my life I can turn to for emotional support. I have deep seated trust and abandonment issues stemming from my upbringing so I don't let friends help me when I need emotional support for fear that they'll abandon me because of my mental illnesses. Being abandoned because of my mental illnesses has become a norm in my life and every time it happens it drains more of the goodness out of me. I used to be cheerful, flirtatious and charming, but I've become cold, callous and bitter.

I just want someone to come into my life who wants to see me happy. I have nobody cheering me on. I have nobody for emotional support whatsoever and all I want is to be able to be hugged when I absolutely need one to stop from breaking down.


Everyone always tells me that I need to love myself before someone else can love me. The problem is I have never loved myself. I have never known what that is like and no matter how hard I try I just cant find any way to like anything about myself.

So if I need to love myself to be loved then, fuck, guess I'll just die sad and alone like I always feared I would.

Anyways thanks for coming to my TEDtalk, all zero of you."
601,It’s so hard,depression,I’ve just felt like shit I fucked it up with my bestfriend and I’m still at his house and I just can’t even seem to be able to breathe easy it’s just getting harder and I can’t do it anymore I just wanna leave it’ll just be so much easier when I don’t have to worry anymore
602,"Last night I felt so bad, I wrote something down, I just wanted to share it.",depression,"""I feel like shit. Weekends should be relieving, but lately they just feel like countdowns until next Monday. I don't want to talk to anyone, or share anything. I have a small suspicion that no one besides my close family likes me, that everyone just tolerates my presence. I don't blame them, it's my fault for being unable to be myself around others.

Instead I'm so afraid of not being liked, so anxious about saying something stupid, that I end up saying nothing at all. In every social interaction I reduce myself to a chat bot, never taking the first step, never asking questions, only reacting to input. My only goal is to not be judged, not be made fun of.

Well no one makes fun of me that's for sure, they just see a dull, shy boy who seems nice on the outside but on the inside is hollow.""

I normally don't like what I write, it always feels fake, but this felt very honest."
603,Every freaking time I feel better people have to knock me freaking back down.,depression,"It's so exhausting. My roommate A gets me to come out of my room to play a game. I'm like okay I'm feeling better and a nice game might be fun. 

So I get out there and I'm sitting there waiting for like 10 minutes as we wait for roommate B to finish something so they can join. 

I decided to go get on my computer real quick in my room and just do a little more job searching while we wait on roommate B. Literally two minutes later I walk out to grab a drink and they just started without me. 

As soon as I walked away they had freaking just jumped in and started a game. No one said anything or came to get me when B was done. Guess they didn't really want me to play. I don't get why even bother inviting me to play. Guess it must be some fun cruel joke."
604,Why is music such a double-edge sword?,depression,Sometimes hearing a song that perfectly describes what you're going through and how you're feeling can be the most comforting thing in the world. But it also just makes you more depressed. But I can't stop listening to them because it feels like those lyrics are the only thing that understand what I'm going through. Idek if this makes any sense. Maybe it's just me
605,Hi,depression,I’m saying hi to you because I don’t have anyone else to say hi to
606,I just want to agree with everyone telling me to kill myself,depression,"I work in a field where online hate is unfortunately a regular occurrence, partly because fans in this industry can be toxic and  partly because I'm not a straight white dude so when people dislike what I do or say, it almost always devolves into personal attacks as opposed to legitimate criticism. 

It sucks but most days it doesn't faze me too much. Except when I make a mistake. Doesn't matter how big or small the screwup is, I've always been incredibly hard on myself when I mess up and it usually triggers a depressive episode. So when the internet hordes start coming at me telling me I'm an idiot and a piece of shit and should just kill myself, I'm honestly like yeah, you're right. I should. I fucked up, and I don't deserve to live to see another day. 

I know it sounds dramatic, but that's exactly the kind of intrusive thought my depression starts feeding me whenever I make a mistake. So to hear people other than myself repeat it just sinks what little self-confidence I have and makes me wonder why I even bother."
607,I don't love my Family (ive tried to keep this short rather than ranting &lt;3),depression,"Basically, I've grown up as an only child and a victim to my families expectation, i'm sure everyone does. Anyway, I've recently been looking into emotional and family abuse, turns out the reason i have anxiety, stress and guilt issues is because of my fucking parents. They guilt trip me into things without realising, (i may not have disclosed that they love me, but i hate that and they do hurtful things without knowing) and overall i have become numb to many emotions, hate empathy and love, and have constant breakdowns and suicidal thoughts because i'm sick of their constant nit-picking and the other shit they do."
608,getting help but I'm scared,depression,"Hi I'm not sure if anyone will even read this but I (22, F) rang and made an appointment with my gp to talk about my mental health and I'm really scared they won't take me seriously. I've tried everything, being active, the colouring, the mindfulness, therapy even .art therapy when the regular kind didn't help. I don't know what else to do. I feel like all I do is sleep and wait around feeling guilty for not going to college, doing my work or even anything I enjoy anymore. Everything feels pointless and I don't have any interest in life anymore. I'm not sure how to even get these things across to my gp. It's an appointment over the phone and I don't know how to gather my thoughts for it, any advice would be appreciate."
609,Im not suicidal but I dont feel like living,depression,"I (16m) don't want to go one. The best way I can say is that scene in rocky 5, where mick says ""i dont have a reason to go on"" thats how I feel. I failed one class and my driver's test by one question and now my moms mad and saying im going to be a bum. Before today she said she wanted a chri list from me and i didn't know what I wanted so I put down 3 things and I heard her on the phone this morning saying that its stupid and short. I don't know what to do and I feel like a complete failure and im just emotionally drained. I cant really talk to my mom because she'll get mad. I've tried talking to her before and she got mad. She cut ties with the rest of her family so by default I did too. My dad and his new family are hardly there so I feel like i have no one. I don't know what i can do. Like I said before im bot suicidal."
610,I dont know how to keep myself up,depression,"Hey, I dont know if anyone will read this post, but I dont mind. I just dont have anyone to tell about my problems. 

I'm 21yo guy, I cant enjoy anything, love or family or anything. Only thing I can still fell is sadness and loneliness. I feel like shit for 9 years. Nothing helped, I tried using meds from my psychiatrist but it didnt help at all. I felt even worse. Yesterday I visited my psychologist after 6months (I couldnt met her because of corona) And when I started talking I immediately wanted to cry because holding my feelings and thoughts inside my head for a long time is difficult. But it didnt help, talking is only worse because it reminds me of my suffering. I just want to get help or something that will cure me or change my personality, I cant live like that, Im just not strong enough. 

The worst part of it is nobody know about my pain. Not even my mother, I just can't tell her how I feel because it would hurt her. She thinks I'm fine and everything is fine. 

I've often thought about suicide this year. End my misery, end this fucking life and finally end my sadness. But the hardest thing for me would be to leave my mom without knowing what happened. And goodbye letter would hurt her even more. 

How can I change my life? What can I do ? Zero friends whole life, everybody thinks I'm weird because I'm quiet. But when I'm talking I can see in their eyes loosing interest in me. 

Sorry for this messy post, but I just wanted to vent. Thank you for your attention. And if you maybe want to talk with me, I will be waiting."
611,Living with and being surrounded by people with opposing views is so exhasting.,depression,It's a constant battle to not express my views because it's always ends in an argument. It's like I'm always pretending to be someone I'm not. I just wear this mask that says who I'm supposed to be.
612,Does depression make someone unsuitable for a relationship?,depression,Lately I (26M) feel like my depression makes me unsuitable to b in a relationship with a woman. I keep thinking that I be much happier to make me appealing to people in general and women in particular. I’ve been trying to focus less on this and more on my hobbies but I have moments where depression and anxiety take over. Right now I feel like this is stupid to ask so I don’t blame anyone for not answering. Or even answer harshly.
613,I'm tired of being tired,depression,"I can't read books anymore, I have a hard time getting into shows, I wear headphones all day but I barely listen to music, a catalog of games to play but none of them call my attention, I should be studying but looking at anything study-related just makes me feel worse because I'm never doing good enough.

I wake up and I'm tired of being asleep, I go to sleep because I'm tired of being awake. I can't cry, but it feels like I'm about to so often. 

My head keeps repeating it over and over everyday, ""Should I just die?"", ""What if I kill myself?"", ""Is anything even worth it anyway?"". I don't know how to look at life and be interested when everything is just ""meh"" so often."
614,Struggling to find motivation during COVID-19 Pandemic,depression,"Hi everyone, I’m not one to usually post but... I’ve found myself in a really dark place recently, and figured I’d reach out to others struggling to seek guidance. 

I’m a 21 yr old female living in California. I go to school full time and work part time. I was recently diagnosed with COVID and have fallen extremely behind in my classes, and have received a lot of criticism from peers since my diagnosis. People blamed me for being sick, shunned me, and left me to “think about my actions,and how they affect others”. I’ve been confined to a room for weeks, with the school monitoring my every move..I’m feeling extremely suicidal and overall just very sad and lost.

I have finals next week, and an overwhelming amount of homework due, but all I can find the strength to do is sleep,eat,cry, repeat. I’m struggling to write my essays or study for my exams. 

I’m really worried about my mental health. I had a therapist who, because of the semester ending, had ended our sessions a few days ago. 

My mother, is putting a lot of pressure on me to do well in school, and I’m letting her and my whole family down. I’m currently facing a potential explosion from college for problems with my roommate and I having a guest over at the dorms ... 

So all in all... I’m about to fail all my classes. Get kicked out of college, and need to find a new place to live within a few weeks... I can barely get out of bed ... and I’ve gained over 50 pounds in the last 3 months... I need help. I’m scared..

I’m also having a lot of problems with my boyfriend who; since me becoming depressed and gaining weight has seemingly lost interest in me... 

I apologize if my writing seems just like I’m complaining , I hate to be that girl... but I don’t know who else to talk to right now.. 

How do you cope when you feel like the world is crashing down on you? How do you find happiness again? I feel like everything that used to make me so happy like dance (and also my current major), hasn’t made me feel good in a long time... 

I’m drowning. 

*I don’t have a suicidal plan and don’t feel like I’ll harm myself ... at least not now...*"
615,..,depression,God help me to go through this..
616,My mom didn’t want to see me on thanksgiving,depression,"This is just a rant so I don’t want any sympathy or anything.

She claimed it was because she was worried about covid which is reasonable. But then I found out she dumped me my brother and my sister at our dads so she could spend thanksgiving with my other brother and the fucking neighbors. What the fuck mom. Everybody and their grandma was there why did you do that man"
617,I have given up on my life,depression,"I have come to the conclusion that nothing will come of it. No good or bad, I am simply a waste of time, money, and space. I am a sad pathetic insignificant blemish on this earth and I will never be anything I truly want to be or have anything I truly want to have. My existence is a tragic joke and my life is a disgusting waste. I don’t plan to kill myself but I am not afraid of death anymore, and if it happens I would not be surprised and neither should anyone else."
618,Why does hearing this make me feel worse?,depression,"I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety (and arguably bipolar disorder). A guy I'm dating asked how I was doing, to which I replied ""eh not gonna lie, I've been feeling pretty depressed today"". He then proceeds to reassure me that he still likes me......I just realized that I hadn't even thought about that, until now. At this point, I'm upset and teary eyed because after decades of inner work, I got to the point where I didn't even think to seek his approval of who I am when I don't feel my best, and he just reminded me of it. I don't feel as disappointed in myself as I do with him for implying that would even be on my mind. My depression has nothing to do with him, but he made it about him while also indirectly insulting me? Am I just being overly sensitive?"
619,"Got fired, again",depression,"Early 2020 my boyfriend almost broke up with me. I was at my lowest again. Then my flatmate threw me out. Then I lost my internship due to corona. I finally found a new job in July. It was hard for the first months. I finally started to like it now. Thursday they fired me without naming any reasons. My colleague told me they are restructuring the company and they didn‘t need me anymore.
I know both times leaving the company was not my fault or connected to my skills or anything. Still, I lost my daily routine and so many lovely colleagues in one day. I am trying to keep contact with them, sure, but it‘s not the same. I just want to go back and work there. I was happy in a job for the very first time. It‘s not the money I am worried about. I just want to do my thing there again with my colleagues and the customers, joke around, have my routine.
I lay on my couch all day, barely eat, always cry. Sending boyfriend and family away, want to be alone. I know that’s not how I am supposed to handle it but I cannot help it.

Any insight, tips?

Edit: thanks for these hugs and buttons up there! Idk what they do but I appreciate them!"
620,im here to talk if you need anything,depression,"hi im willow! im 11 and diagnosed with clinical depression and aspergers syndrome! im still fairly optimistic so if anyone needs someone to talk to im here! :D i want to be a psychiatrist when i grow up so i thought "" if i can try to help anyone, ill be closer  to my dream... of course sometimes i need help too so id be hoping that we could  kinda be there for eachother! if not i hope life gets better

621,I just want to die,depression,"Hi.

I really want to die right now, as in today. Now. and maybe even doxx the girl that set me up, and ruined my life through lies, and has driven me to this head space. Honestly I could sue the crap out of her and probably win but at that point it costs so much money, time, and you have to relive all of the terrible things that happened, multiple times. The defense will do everything in their power to try to prove that you’re a piece of shit and the claims are untrue. That process would probably make me feel even worse. 

I know that I’m not alone in this battle of my brain literally torturing itself 24/7, so to me it really doesn’t matter that I’m not “alone.” I’ve been screwed over by so many people that I deeply cared about and that has caused me to isolate from everyone else and I really like it that way. 

My question is, does anyone who knows what struggle I’m talking about have any eye bleach or whatever you call it? A link to a video, article, picture, or story that made them smile or they thought was very wholesome? 

*As a note, I’ve heard some pretty bad things about the suicide help line so I really don’t want to do that, neither does hearing “you’re not alone” really help me out in my specific case. I guess I’m more after cheery media in an attempt to fight every urge in my body to write a note and slit my wrists, and go in peace, on my terms, my control, no one else’s decision. Mine.*

I just don’t have a lot of faith in the world right now. The handling of COVID, corporate greed, people who do terrible things to other humans, and the fact that we are literally the disease of our home, earth. Those adding into this issue doesn’t help at all."
622,Uncertainty about the future,depression,"I'm so scared about my future, I can't see myself happy, with a job, a partner, a dog, a house and these kind of things, I can only see myself as unemployed and even more depressed person."
623,My attempt TW: suicide,depression,"I’ve never told anyone my story it’s been a couple months sense my last attempt. During quarantine I became very depressed I started self harming I was super under wait it felt like I had no hope left. I started thinking how my life would be so much better if I wasn’t here how it would be a relieve. I wrote letters and sent them to they belonged to I told them why I waunted to and what I’ve been keeping from them. It was around 1:30 A.M and I took 45 pain killers I remember I did it in the bathroom. I woke up in the hospital my parents and sister besides me they were all crying I had to go to a mental hospital for a month. I’m very great full that I’m still here I’ve met some amazing people. 
    

       Please if you need help reach out you don’t haft to do this alone you are loved 
 
          Thank you."
624,"What percent of people do icky hard drugs like cocaine, heroin etc?",depression,"Hard drugs like cocaine, heroin, meth, etc? I feel like it is better to post on one other than a drugs sub because it may give some the false impression more do it because their social life is around people who tend to use it more. 

I myself have tried one of these a few times but havent in a few years. We hear about the opioid epidemic and it sucks, but I feel like those affected by it is still 1-2-%. As for other hard drugs 1-2% each so 3-6% of people in America are using hard drugs at least once a month, if not every other day. 

I feel sorry for
Those who live in places with high hard drug abuse."
625,Bad headspace,depression,"Really bad headspace.
So, my Parain (Godfather) is buying me a new phone because my current one is having connection issues.
I didn’t want him to spend more money on a thing like me, so I tried to contact him again to hurry up and cancel the phone order. 
(I didn’t know he ordered it until my parents told me)
My Dad was angry that I wanted to contact him to tell him to cancel the order. 

We got into an argument. I did raise my voice. I was upset that my parents never let me finish what I’m saying and always write me off as being a ignorant person. 
Anyway, my Dad got up and walked towards me while yelling at me. Told me to shut my damn mouth. I thought he was gonna hit me. He didn’t. Just sat back down on the couch.
It just really scared me because I know he could’ve hit me. But what scares me the most is that I don’t know IF he would’ve.

I’m 21-years-old. 
I’m a young adult.
I’m...I’m just tired. I don’t want to hear any encouraging words. 
I have cried silently in such a long time. That kind of cry where your chest is in so much pain, you have a headache, and you’re just blissfully numb.

...I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe I just want someone to listen. Anyone. I’m tired of having nobody to talk to."
626,Help,depression,"I’m sorry I don’t know where to post this, but a mate of mine is really going through it, and he’s currently on a wait list to get help and has been waiting for 6 MONTHS!! I don’t know how to help him and I know it sounds terrible but he’s starting to drain me and I’m also dealing with a lot myself. Ive accompanied him on walks and I always answer his texts and calls, but I feel useless because it doesn’t seem to help. I told him to try meditation, try exercising and/or keep a diary, but he says he doesn’t have the energy for those things, so I told him to look into his diet, but he doesn’t have energy to cook. So can anyone please tell me what I can do for him? Or what I can advise him to do so he can find energy? I’m sorry if this post is insensitive to anyone, and thank you all for your help in advance."
0,2020 Umbrella Thread,Anxiety,"With 2020 shaping up to be an extremely difficult year, we have decided to move towards a more general type of megathread. On this thread we are going to promote mental health-related discussion centered on any stressful events that are going on right now.

In addition, we will use this thread to attempt to compile various different resources (mainly useful, more specific discussion threads) as well as provide a generic place to discuss anything related to what is happening this year. We will be updating this post as often as possible. If we identify any new posts that will serve as good additions to our “Discussion Links” section we’ll add them. Feel free to suggest any, even if it’s your own post!

**Guidelines**

We expect that some discussion will revolve around politically-themed issues. These are allowed, but we request that the discussion stays about the impact it has had on your own mental health or the people around you.

We are not here to debate this versus that, to try and tear each other down or to shame people for struggling to cope with all that is happening. Instead we want to foster an environment that allows people to talk about the mental issues they’ve been encountering and to provide support.

If any comment or post seems to be getting way too heated, please report them and we will do our best to handle the situation.

If you are sharing links or news, please remember to *consider the source*.  If you are feeling outraged or upset by a headline, take the article with a grain of salt and remember that whoever is writing it may have something to gain just from getting a high number of clicks.  

**How To Suggest New Links**

There are two ways that you can get new links added to this post. This is one instance where self-promotion is okay in the sense that if the link is something you made (such as a Reddit discussion post), that is alright.

1. Make a comment on this post with the suggestion + link, and include the word ‘mods’ in the comment. This is the preferred way since it will also allow other people to weigh in on the suggestion.
1. Send us a private mod mail with the suggestion + link.

We can’t guarantee that every suggestion will be approved but we’ll review each one regardless.

1,"Sunday General Chat Thread - November 29, 2020",Anxiety,"""Happy Sunday! What does your week look like?

Both anxiety related and off-topic discussion is allowed. Rules regarding potential triggers still apply."""
2,The worst thing about anxiety,Anxiety,"You know what the worst thing about anxiety is?


How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‘t feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.


I just want a break man, I‘m tired of feeling like dying over things that have many solutions to it.


Generalized anxiety is a bitch"
3,Can’t Sleep! Can anyone else hear their heart beat whilst trying to sleep?,Anxiety,"Been quite a stressful year but sleep has really been difficult for me this year. I had therapy to cope with anxiety because I thought I had a heart issue, turns out I just suffer with health anxiety. 

I’m really struggling to sleep now because I just constantly hear my heart beat in my ear..does anyone else suffer with this? Is it normal?

Just so tired of worrying about my health all the time."
4,"The best method for beating my severe anxiety has been : (feel free to share what you did, this has changed my life)",Anxiety,"I started medication, and it gave me a leg up, I was able to think more rationally and the physical symptoms of my anxiety subsided. So I used this help to start applying what I learned. I FACE/ACCEPT/FLOAT, in scary situations and when I get a bodily urge that makes me anxious. I face it completely and do not fight, I accept the situation or feeling, and I float through it, not fighting or resisting."
5,Do y’all ever feel behind in life?,Anxiety,"I’ve always had a lot of anxiety about life but it’s gotten so much worse this year. I’m 23(I know I’m young), but I can’t help but feel like not where I’m suppose to be. A lot of my friends are currently engaged, married, some have kids, and the rest with the exception of two are currently in serious relationships. I was with a guy that I genuinely saw myself marrying but now I’m single again. Most of my friends have some type of degree, while I’m starting over from the very beginning next semester and becoming a freshman again to get mine, which will take the entire 4 years. I had planned to move to a new state this summer whenever quarantine was ramping up but decided to stay because of school and family. I know I’m ultimately making decisions that will make my life better in the future but I can’t help but get discouraged when I see where other people I know are at in life right now. This shit just really sucks. I hate feeling this way but I can’t turn it off."
6,I had to take a tranqilizer before sending a text to someone today,Anxiety,"That's how bad it's gotten. I can't even send friggin' texts anymore without absolute panic. This can't be where my life is headed. It can't. 

What're some thing that have helped y'all that I can try?"
7,Thank you.,Anxiety,"I have been anxiety free for almost four months, therefore I will be leaving this subreddit. I will return if I have a relapse, but i hope that doesn't happen. Thank you."
8,Does anyone sigh a lot?,Anxiety,I am constantly sighing/taking deep breath. Anyone else?  Just found out it is correlated with anxiety.
9,PLEASE DONT POST ABOUT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!!!,Anxiety,"My mom posted several times on her Facebook talking about my recent hospital (psych ward) stay. (I’m 19, was 18 at the time, like it matters anyway, you shouldn’t post anyone’s personal info on social media whether they are your kid as a minor or not) Luckily she didn’t mention the psych ward part but I asked her to take it down because it’s private and no ones business but my own and my doctors but she didn’t so I had to resort to publicly commenting;

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.” 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can’t go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won’t tolerate that shit. I’m not a minor any more, I’m a grown ass adult, and if I didn’t live in her house still she wouldn’t know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

Edit;
Of course she bitch at me about it and said “take down whatever you want to take down. I’m done with it.” 
I dont care at this point. I did what I had to do."
10,I took a mental health day!,Anxiety,"I know it might seem like a strange thing to celebrate, but I’ve been ashamed of my anxiety disorder for years. I tend to my push myself to the absolute limit until I eventually breakdown from stress. Well I’ve been super anxious lately, I basically had an all day panic attack yesterday, so I called in and said I was sick. I’ve done nothing, been totally unproductive and I feel amazing. I didn’t even realise how much I needed this. Feeling super proud."
11,How do you know when you’ve had a breakdown or need to check into a mental facility?,Anxiety,"I’m going some major shit at work where they keep threatening to fire me - and I wish they would get it over with - but I also need the money

I’m already on meds - but my anxiety keeps coming through 

I don’t want to hurt myself - but I am in a bad mental state - feel like I’m in a deep hole and can’t climb out. 

How do you know when you’re having a breakdown?  Or when you check yourself into a mental health facility?

Thx"
12,You are more resilient than you think,Anxiety,"I'm finally subsiding from a panic attack that started five hours ago. I wouldn't wish what I just went through on anybody, but I know it's a reality for a lot of us, so I just wanted to shout out to everyone that you are not alone and you are strong!"
13,I am gonna have to move from my dorm to my familys house in 18 days and I just realized...,Anxiety,"I am gonna have to move from my dorm to my familys house in 18 days and I just realized that the sheer thought of having to move back to that house is giving so much anxiety that I have to take SSRIs to deal with the depression and anxiety that is associated with living in that house.

For context I have severe depression and anxiety before holidays and at first I thought it was just normal seasonal depression and then I asked myself ”Why do I feel this way” and I realized that I am so horrified of having to live at my familys house that it gives me severe depression and anxiety."
14,I practiced trumpet nearly everyday for a week!!!,Anxiety,I used to never practice trumpet as homework for my trumpet lessons. This would result in me hating myself. This cycle lasted months and each week I hated myself even more. But I broke the cycle and practiced nearly everyday! Even if it was just for 10 minutes!
15,Finally realising the trauma of losing my fingers,Anxiety,"I chopped the tips of my fingers off as a child. 
I have always felt kind of silly for being bothered by it, like loads of people have a lot worse. 
It's on my dominant hand but doesn't stop me writing or anything, just hurts when I do certain things.
A lot of people react badly to it and say awful things but I always felt silly for being upset by this.
I am finally realising that it is ok to realise this was traumatic."
16,"SO over feeling anxious, unmotivated and blah!!!",Anxiety,"For months now I've been so incredibly unmotivated and have been experiencing more depressive downs than usual, as well as my general anxiety not being the greatest. I feel like every day I'm worrying about something- the weird feeling in my head, my heart, the possibility of getting the virus, etc., etc., and it makes me feel so blah and down. And the unmotivated feeling is so obnoxious because I have SO much I want and need to do... I graduated in spring with my degree in graphic design and I have done close to nothing since. I see so many people just constantly creating and pumping shit out and I feel like I'm wasting so much freaking time, especially being 36, but for the life of me I can't bring myself to much of anything other than slightly keeping up on the chores, and even then I'm struggling. And then beyond that I'm so sick of feeling like I can't hang out with people and such because of social distancing- I'm semi high risk,  my dad is 74 and my father in law is super high risk, so I've been playing it super safe, but I see friends of mine out there acting like shit is normal and I have my amazing husband, but I still feel so alone.. ugh there's just so much.. I dunno, I just needed to vent to people who I know will know exactly how I feel... I know this year is hard on everyone and so many people are going through emotional shit.. I hope sometime sooner than later things can feel a bit more normal and we can all get some relief. Any supportive words or helpful advice on anything I said is of course welcome. Cheers to all, and happy holidays."
17,"This book will change your life ! Take it from me, severe anxiety, panic disorder, and health anxiety. It will even help with Insomnia and it’s short and simple !!!",Anxiety,The book is “hope and help for your nerves” by Claire weekes !! It is like 4$ used!!! It will make a world of difference for you ! It took me one day to read and really laid out everything for me.
18,I once wrote a poem about my anxiety,Anxiety,"Does anyone feel like this?

Heads hurting, 
Stomachs turning,
I’m too uncertain,
The panics burning,
As my mind sways,
Quotes start repeating in many ways,
My face goes red,
I react to what was said, 
Let me rest my head into the pillow of my bed,
I attempt to read their mind,
The thoughts bind,
They become stronger,
I think about them longer,
Anger and emotions compete,
I feel them from my head to my feet"
19,My mom thinks I have anxiety and depression because of ALLERGIES,Anxiety,"My mom, who has never accepted the fact that I’m introverted and depressed— who never let me go to therapy growing up because it would be on my ‘record’— told me this morning that she has been doing so much RESEARCH and has discovered that the reason I deal with mental illness is because I grew up with allergies and eczema, which translated to scarring on my brain??

I’m 21, I still live at home. So she’s always upset at me because I work slowly and she says I have no drive. Her explanation also included things like, “You used to want to leave here so bad! At some point in your life something *switched* and it’s cause you were overwhelmed with your allergies!”

At first I was just amused, but then she kept going and I started getting really pissed. Like, NO, mother. Maybe I have mental illnesses because of my horrible school experiences since 2nd grade and your failure to take me seriously or provide me with HELP during the darkest moments of my life?

Well, I told her something like that. Her response? “The scarring made those experiences seem worse than they were.”

Then she proceeded to send me articles to read. Now, I’m not saying that allergies and stress have ZERO connection at all, but for her to say that I’m *broken* solely because I grew up sneezing and avoiding peanut butter and that I can be *fixed* by supplements and yoga was just insane. 

I’m just— what even??"
20,Lost my earphones and am having an anxiety attack over it,Anxiety,"I am very meticulous when it comes to knowing where my things are and treating my possessions well so they last long. The other week though I lost my earphones and felt really upset about it, but have grown a little resilience to be able to tell myself I can just use a new set since we have so many at home. However, a few weeks later I lose my earphones again, and I’m just having this full blown anxiety attack over it and I don’t really know why. It’s so uncharacteristic of me and not knowing what happened to them and where I may have gone wrong absolutely drives me nuts. I’m thinking it possibly has something to do with obsession with control over my life - wanting things to be a certain way and wanting to know exactly what is going on in my life. I’m not sure, I never really am sure of anything. Anyone have any insight or thoughts to shed on what my situation? Or maybe just a situation that made you feel a similar way?"
21,Can you relate?,Anxiety,"Anxiety

Anxiety is like hitting that brick wall over and over again and hoping that maybe one slate will come loose; spoiler alert it never does. 
Anxiety is the tightening of your chest, getting in an ambulance and hoping you’re in cardiac arrest. Anxiety is circling the drain, hoping that it will suck you in and you’ll never surface, that the oxygen is too far away. Anxiety is replaying memories and thinking what you could have done and what you didn’t do. Anxiety is not talking to friends and family for weeks, months, years and you’re too scared to contact them, they’ll forget about you anyway. Every day is the same and you believe you can’t change. It’s not wanting to meet up with anyone. Or making plans and quickly pulling out; your four walls are the comfort you want. Anxiety is people believing you’re being self centred, that you’re just lazy. Anxiety feels like a huge hole in your head, burning every day as you try and process normal things like a human. It feels like fire in the nerves whenever you need to answer the phone; finding an excuse to quickly turn the cell over and ignore it. It’s the feeling of nothing, of the nights you cried yourself to sleep. It’s the feeling that you’ll never see the end of the day, even though it’s 11PM. A never ending cycle that seems to be a ground hog day. Depression is deeper, it sticks to you like glue. Everywhere you go, you catch a glimpse of a family member who’s no longer here. You lie at night, your heart thumping in your ears and the memories replaying. For me, it’s my uncle G lying in his coffin. My mum saying to touch his hand, then when I did she said it warmed to me; although it was stone cold. I went outside, sat on the cold step, looked to the stars and put my earphones in. I cried. I must have cried for 2 hours before anyone even came looking. I grew up fast from this, I was only 12. I knew my uncle george was in that room, or the carcass of my uncle G Depression is in your marrowbone, it seeps like fungi and weighs you down. You cry. For me, I feel everything. I feel everything that others should feel. I feel too much, I think too much. I need constant reassurance, I need to be treated like a child because I’ve never had the chance to be one."
23,could this be from anxiety,Anxiety,can anxiety cause slow motion feelings. I have had about 4 episodes of this slow motion feeling ever since my first panic attack
24,“PANIC ATTACK PRANK ON BOYFRIEND!! **cute reaction** 💕🙌🏻 | Piper Rockelle,Anxiety,"Is this what kids are watching these days? This is so fucking disgusting. Piper Rockelle always struck a nerve with me but THIS is what really drew the line. I got it in my recommended for whatever reason, and I literally couldn’t believe my eyes. You don’t fake panic attacks? Like ever? How hard is that to understand? I cannot explain how messed up it is to use an actual problem that people face everyday for clout. I wouldn’t even watch it because I absolutely refuse to give attention to things like this, putting a terrible stigma on mental illness in general. What kind of sick person do you have to be in order to look at a panic attack, something that makes you feel like you’re going to DIE, and then say “hey, this would be a good prank to pull on someone!” Um... no? Any decent person who has to deal with constant panic attacks knows for certain that they are not fun and you don’t want to have them. This is putting a terrible stain on the children who watch this channel. Now they’ll all think that this prank is all cute and funny because “omg her boyfriend was so sweet look at how he reacted, so cute.” You never fake a panic attack. Never. So disrespectful."
25,The world terrifies me (rant),Anxiety,"I'm out of money, rent is due, and I'm too scared to get a job after a lost my last one.

I lost my job in October because of a depressive episode. I also moved out of my parents out with some friends.

I'm scared of them getting mad at me, of kicking me out. I'm scared of leaving my room. Of scared of the public and of my own mind.

I know how I get. When I get a certain way I can't function and I lose any sense of reality. 

I have no idea what to do. I've tried at home jobs and considered sex work because I don't know what I can do. I just want to be able to live. Maybe I don't. I don't really perceive anything external anymore.

I'm lost and I'm scared and my head hurts. Nothing makes sense and I feel so small. The universe crushes me if I don't have a roof to protect me.

I can't be with people and I can't be alone.

Oh well. As is life."
26,Anti Anxiety Medication,Anxiety,"2020 has been tough. After finishing college at the end of last year, I moved back home. Before I was able to get a job in my field, covid-19 happened. I’m still living at home, but now I have a job. It’s my dream job, but it’s remote and I don’t earn enough to move out yet. 

My relationship with my dad became quite unhealthy this year. I’m not entirely sure why, or what changed. I went to a psychologist and she recommended we do therapy together. He wouldn’t come, and there have been a few incidents over the course of the year that are very toxic. 

Recently, we had another incident and I think I had a mild panic attack afterwards. I’ve been battling to sleep and just feeling out of place and uncomfortable since. I’d like to get on anti-anxiety medication short-term until 1) my brother goes back to to Europe in 3 months (he perpetuates the toxic behavior of my dad and is quite a toxic man himself) or 2) I can afford to move out, or 3) the relationship with my dad improves (best case scenario)

Will anti-anxiety medication alter my brain forever? I don’t want to rely on it for the rest of my life. I’d rather not get on it if I’ll become dependent on it for longer than 6 months. I think my anxiety is purely circumstantial. In the past, I have not battled with mental health. It’s only this year, and during/as a result of confrontations."
27,what are some of your coping techniques for anxiety,Anxiety,"I've been feeling kinda bad lately when it comes to anxiety and If anyone could suggest something, It'd be of great appreciation"
28,i want to help those with anxiety so i came up with a course,Anxiety,Although i do not have much experience in this area i wanted to help the world out. My knowledge comes from other courses and psychiatrists. I want to know where can i post my course? it is roughly 22 pages long.
29,I've entered an online class and I don't think I can do it,Anxiety,I found an online class on a subject I like and I was really excited about it. Turns out we're in groups and have to work together. Everyone shares their screen and discusses. It's just like a real class and I don't think I can do it. Thinking of dropping out. I haven't talked to anyone except a couple of people I know for months and this just seems too overwhelming.
30,"Fear of aging, mortality and a lot of nostalgia feelings about childhood",Anxiety,"Hello, for a few weeks I’ve just been stuck with the thoughts that i’m gonna die one day, i’m going to lose my parents one day, my cats are most likely going to die in 10-15 years, I don’t want a new life when I die I don’t want to sleep forever and just not exist, I don’t want my memories to be gone when I die and forget the people I love and many more related thoughts. Those thoughts make me feel anxious for the whole day, I just cannot talk with my parents without having those thoughts and do even something like look at clothes online and think why if we all are going to die, it feels like i’m stuck and it feels like I don’t want to live in this world. Also because of this I have a really big fear of the future and aging. I’m currently 17, i’m still young and i’m almost 18, it scares me. I know it is just a number and nothing really changes, but I don’t want to, it feels like yesterday when I was just little and I miss my childhood untill 11 years old. I miss being innocent and little. Since I started to have these nostalgic feelings and thoughts and missing my childhood I started to change, I couldn’t stand makeup anymore, things I used to like in my teens. I only find comfort in things of when I was a child, I basically want to be a child again, and my parents to be younger.. and that is so impossible but I can’t handle it.. in my 12’s things started to change and from my 14 till 15 I was really rebellious and treated my parents really badly and a lot of things I did then and what happened to me I really regret to this day, and I just also feel this big guilt on my shoulders towards my parents for how I was at that time, a lot of guilt that I spent at my 14,15 doing shit that just ruined my innocence. I’m currently in a 2 year relationship and since then I changed a lot and became a better person, which matters. And I love my parents more than ever but the guilt is eating me. I’m not going to tell everything because it will be too long and has not a lot to do with my title. But I LOVE MY PARENTS VERY MUCH. 
Since this July i’ve started to have intrusive thoughts which switched to a lot of other themes fucked up themes , causing me panic attacks. Kinda looks like OCD to me, I still haven’t been diagnosed and I’m getting therapy and went to a psychiatrist, but because i’m having really bad sleep problems she only prescribed something to sleep. I’m going back there in 3 weeks and I hope I get something like antidepressants, because since July it never stopped. Now I’m really depressed, not being able to do anything and only guilt feelings and negative thoughts are what I live with everyday. But these kind of thoughts I have about my and other people’s mortality, aging and the future, that I miss my childhood and just want to go back are stuck now with me everyday and it never stops. I still haven’t talked about my therapist about it because we are discussing about my past and my guilt feelings but I’m definitely going to bring this one up Tuesday. But I can remember having these kind of thoughts since when I was like 11 and keeping me up at night and crying myself to sleep. This started at very young and once in a while I always had these kind of thoughts, but now i’m having these thoughts almost 2 weeks everyday, idk what to do anymore"
31,I hate that my thoughts are still warped by anxiety and depression and I cant even recognise it,Anxiety,"So just for some quick backstory:

I emailed an old teacher last week about how uni was going and she never replied. The first few days I was always anxiously checking my inbox and just sleeping the hours away so I didnt have to be awake an feel so anxious. Then after a few days I resigned myself to the fact I wouldnt get a response. And my head started filling with stupid thoughts that I was a burden and that they didnt want to stay in contact. But I didnt think I was feeling anxious or depressed about them responding. The thoughts I was having were, to me, perfectly valid and definitely why I hadn't got a response.

I know it sounds stupid that an old teacher replying to me was that important but this was and still is a really important relationship to me even if it slightly one sided. And deep down I know is a big part of why I'm still here today.  They were the first adult I had felt comfortable around (except for my mum) in over a decade (and I'm only 19) if not all my life.  

But I checked my inbox this evening looking for something completely different stuff not expecting there to be a reply and if anything feeling depressed that everytime I had to email someone or look for something in my emails I was reminded that they hadn't replied.

 But I noticed they had finally responded. The relief and happiness was immense. I havent done any uni work for the last week and i wasnt sure why. I hadn't realised how big of an effect it was having on me that I didnt get a reply. But now that I have got that relief i know how bad it was. And I know that thinking that I was a burden and nobody wants to talk to me and I'm annoying is just the anxiety and depression talking. I honestly thought it was a completely acceptable reason that they didnt reply to me. Even though I know that most people wouldnt encourage someone to stay in contact if they didnt truly want to. 

But despite this relief and regained motivation to catch up on my uni work. I feel so annoyed that anxiety and depression have warped my mind so much that I dont recognise the negative or unreasonable thoughts."
32,anxiety keeping me up,Anxiety,just having another late night worrying about things again. i haven’t slept before 4 in like 2 or 3 months. this sucks :/
33,New here,Anxiety,"Just want to introduce myself. I suffer from hypochondria and general anxiety. My family and boyfriend just think I exaggerate or I’m being funny. But it’s a horrific feeling to feel like you have a terrible disease half the time. 

What made it worse is my 19 cousin passed away from a cerebral bleed and a previous boyfriend had a stroke at 42. I have debilitating anxiety at the sign of any weird symptom. Headaches are no longer headaches but a potential life threatening symptom in my mind :( 

I’m just happy I found a place where I can discuss this or see I’m not alone."
34,10 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders,Anxiety," **What is Anxiety?**

The feeling of excessive worrying or anxiousness that a person gets when they have to face a stressful situation is known as anxiety. People describe this feeling as having butterflies in the stomach. Everyone experiences anxiety at some point in their life. Having feelings of anxiousness before an event like giving a speech, appearing for a job interview, or showing up for the first day in school, is very common.

Short-term anxiety is the natural response of our bodies to a stressful situation, and it does not require any medical attention, as such symptoms fade away after the stressful event is over. For some people, symptoms of anxiety might last for much more extended periods like for years. People with long-lasting anxiety need medical attention to treat their anxiety disorder.

35,Why does the thought of going for a run make me so anxious?,Anxiety,"I would usually go for a run and would enjoy it. Now it seems that I have such anxiety from just the thought of going! I’m not sure if it’s the mask/no mask wearing issue or that I don’t run as long as I used to, but I want it to stop! If anyone has any advice on how to approach this and has any experience dealing with this no matter the exercise, it may help me look at it a different way."
36,I started taking CBD,Anxiety,"My anxiety has been so bad lately, to the point where I've been nauseous every day and I can't eat properly because I will throw up. 

Yesterday my sister brought me some cbd oil, I tried it and holy fuck! I didn't even know that my shoulders were tense until I felt them relax. I also slept really well. 

When I woke up today I didn't wanted to throw up like always and I finally could have a proper breakfast, it feels so good to eat until you're full and not stop halfway because of nausea. 

Also, I feel like I need to say that there's no way I'm pregnant, I've had nausea because of anxiety since I was in high school, i normally can handle it but because of current situations it's been getting worse.  

Hopefully this keeps working out."
37,I'm not sure what else to do so I'm looking for any help I can get.,Anxiety,"To make it short, there's this man who's basically threatened and me and I'm trying to get the word out there for my own safety. Hopefully this is allowed and I won't get in trouble. I'm just really scared and want as many people as possible to know about my situation. [Evidence to back up my post](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJXnH9D2/)"
38,Does anybody else get anxiety from watching movies?,Anxiety,"I used to love movies. However, up until recently I can’t watch them because they make me panic and give me headaches. Especially if it’s a movie I haven’t seen before. It doesn’t matter what movie it is, from Toy Story to The Exorcist. Literally every movie I watch makes me uneasy. I can’t follow the dialogue or plot no matter what, and the music stresses me out. Anyone else feel similar?"
39,DAE have sudden Anxiety symptoms?,Anxiety,"Is it coming to develop anxiety symptoms when you never had them before. I believe I have developed nervous stomach issues. I get the feeling of sucking in your stomach really hard but I’m not at all. Also I developed tremors. I will stiffen up and shiver/ shake. I have the shits, a stomachache, headache, and I even threw up earlier today which I’m pretty sure it was all stomach acid. I never throw up. Only times have been when I had the flu and food poisoning, anyone have experience with this?"
40,Looking for someone who may have the same symptoms.,Anxiety,"So I have been dealing with stomach (constant belching) and sinus issues the past few years. It started out with. Sinus infection in which I needed sinus surgery. This caused me so much anxiety. I’ve had so many tests on my stomach and I still cannot fix the belching issue but they find nothing wrong. 

My gastric doctor recommended me seeing a therapist for anxiety who then recommended me to a psychiatrist. 

My anxiety issues are I get super irritable with any slight interruption. I have some fatigue. My stomach belching issues happen all day. I have a nervous stomach. Intrusive thoughts when I’ve been overly anxious all day. Ringing ears. 

Has anyone had some of these symptoms?

I was prescribed lexapro but I have not taken it yet. 

I’m mostly worried about becoming a zombie, the lack of libido, being more fatigued, maybe just not being as passionate about certain things. Can anyone offer some input? I was prescribed 5mg and I have been putting it off."
41,Just started Zoloft but want to stop - okay to quit cold turkey?,Anxiety,"I just started taking Zoloft this past Thursday and not yet this morning, so I’ve taken 4 doses so far, each being half of a .25 mg tablet (I’m very medication phobic and wanted to do it slowly).

Anyway, this has all unfortunately coincided with intense nausea and some of the worst panic attacks and insomnia I’ve experienced in years. I’ve been awake since 3 am and am terrified I’ll never be able to sleep again (just the thought sends another jolt of panic through my body!) I know they say to try to get through it over a couple of weeks but I don’t think I can and am opting to move forward with a commitment to intense exercise and CBT instead (already made an appointment for next week).

My question is, after having taken just half of a .25 mg tablet over the last 4 days, do I need to take any more halves of halves of zoloft tablets at all or can I just go cold turkey? I just want to get off of them with as minimal side effects as possible."
42,Anyone who’s been on Anti anxiety/ depression medication experienced similar?,Anxiety,"Feeling weakness on day 3 of taper Started to taper from 50mg to 25mg, on day 3 and only difference is I have been feeling quite weak in my left arm and leg some small twitches and cramps, brurning skin sensations nothing too extreme but just uncomfortable. Has anyone else had experience in tapering off?"
43,I really am just sick of myself.,Anxiety,"I have all the coping mechanisms, I have come a long way, but sometimes I am just really fucking tired of having to work so hard to get through the day. That's all."
44,Paxil medication,Anxiety,I’ve been taking it for a month. I know that they usually don’t kick in for about a month too. I’m at the lowest dose. I just wondered like how will you know if it’s working for you? Because I can’t tell any difference.
45,Feelings of judgement - where to get help?,Anxiety,"I’ve seen 4 therapists over the last 15 years. None seem to help.  I’m on meds for depression and anxiety - but still feel shitty about myself. 

I realized this past weekend that I hate feeling judged - but I always do.  I’ve always been very shy - and have always felt that others are judging me.  I’m very low confidence.  

Yesterday I remembered two incidents in my past where I friend illness to avoid big life events - that weren’t even about me - but I just couldn’t escape the feeling of being judged and criticized 

I’m tired of going to therapists who don’t really seemed to know how to get to my inner problems.  

Any advice on what to look for in a therapist who specializes in my problems?

There seemed to be a million psych specializations out there.  I get lost trying to figure out who I one can help me."
46,Why do I feel like this?,Anxiety,"For the past months or so I have been getting really bad anxiety, to the point where I feel so anxious to just walk into a grocery store. I still force myself to go in and act normal because I don’t want my brother thinking something is wrong with me. I know that I have nothing to be anxious about because I really only need to focus on school. During high school i would get really bad anxiety in the beginning of the year for about 2 weeks and then I would feel normal again throughout the school year.

My anxiety has never lasted this long and i’m just so tired of it because it has gotten to the point where I can’t hangout with my friends because i am scared that i will be anxious while I’m with them. Recently the anxiety has settled a little, but now I feel sadness, not to the point where I can’t talk to my family members, but it just feels like it’s lingering and it weighs me down. I may have a feeling this is happening because of covid and it has been so long since i’ve been around people who I do talk to. I also think i am having a tough time transitioning out of highschool to where I am now and I just thinking everything is hitting me all at once. Thank you for reading my post, I do have some hope that things will get better but I am just so tired of feeling so anxious and sadness all the time."
47,Anxiety attack,Anxiety,Going through an anxiety attack right now. My whole body gets cold and I start to shake. I know everything is going to be ok and I just have to get through this. Its very hard to type right now so I am going to keep this short.
48,I really just need a friend right now.,Anxiety,"I can't afford a therapist right now. Maybe in the future. I've struggled with anxiety, depression, and other things my whole life, and I recognize when I'm slipping into a dark place. There's so much going on and so much in my head right now, but none of my friends or family are really equipped to be the right sounding board at the moment. 

I just need someone to talk to. Someone to PM me and help me unpack a few things. I'm happy to talk about things you might be struggling with too. I've tried reaching out to Redditors before, but they message once and then never again. I'm really struggling right now and could definitely use a friend. 

I'm 40M, divorced with 3 kids, dating a girl for about 6 months now. I don't care who you are or what your background is if you wanna talk. Just wanna give you an overview of who you're talking to."
49,HELPING YOU GETTING YOUR CONFIDENT BACK!,Anxiety,"Hey guys I'm a guy who's been working on himself for 10 years from now I've been in the same place like you with no confidence, lost didn't know who I am and what is my purpose, but the best thing I've done is start walking the road of change, it was god damn hard at the start coz there's a voice inside my head keep blocking me, I had a lot of doubts about what's gonna happend when I try to change different things about me, then I start learning about human psychology which is very deep and interesting, I've searched in different fields such as social dynamics, energy healing, psychoanalysis, NLP, hypnosis, Shadow work ... All these fields thought me something either I needed to apply to my life or thought me something about myself .. at the end I've come to conclude that if someone wants a real and lifetime change it has to be an identity change basically meaning the way you see yourself and perceive the world around you changed completely, what I found out that a lot of people I helped they weren't achieving this deep change they just try some ideas here and there but deep inside they still the same anxious/stressful/insecure person .. usually what makes change hard is our resistance to a lot of past Traumatic experiences we faced in our childhood that shaped our character and emotions .. 
Among the wide spread symptoms most guys dealing with are : 

- Nice guy Syndrome : you feel like you're hiding something from people all the time, you can't express your emotions in a clear way, because you're ashamed of something that you're not aware of.

- Self attack mindset : there's an agressive voice attacking you all the time, keep feeding you with a lot of dark thoughts. 

- Success barriers mindset: you're unconsciously sabotaging yourself, no matter how you try to improve your life it doesn't work .. 

- Intimate Relationships Problems : it seems like every relationship you're having ends up badly and you don't know why .. 

I hope you guys learned something from this post, for asking about anything contact me on chat .. peace ✨"
50,Being a hypochondriac with Covid.....,Anxiety,"Gotta love it. Wondering every waking minute if I’m having trouble breathing because of the virus or a panic attack. But on the bright side, all the other health problems I was worried about before I got the virus just magically disappeared."
51,i’m worried about my eyes,Anxiety,"today in biology, i used the eye washing station to wash my eyes. afterwards, the teacher told me it hasn’t been used for years and there’s probably rust in the water. this is making me worry a lot, and now all the thinking has made my eyes irritated, and i can’t tell if it’s because of the water or because of my anxiety thinking its irritated."
52,Differential diagnosis Social Anxiety and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia?,Anxiety,"How can a psychologist differentiate the two? A fear of public embarrassment seems to be present in both disorders. 

Would love to hear from you."
53,I don't know how to deal with nighttime panic attacks,Anxiety,"I used to have these a lot but they disappeared for a few months. However now they have come back full force but much, much worse. At least once or twice I wake up panicking, unable to calm down even with breathing techniques etc. I feel nauseous and sometimes throw up. It takes hiurs to go back to bed. How do I fix this?"
54,Anxiety,Anxiety,"I’m 18 years old. No family history of cancer, nun at all. I started having health anxiety bad 4 months ago. I saw a video on YT of a dude dying of sarcoma and ive been petrified ever since. Let’s go down the list in 4 months I have had a brain tumor, testicular cancer , ALS, MS, liver cancer, colon cancer , stomach cancer , cataracts in my eye, glaucoma, prostate cancer and that’s about it. Well I had darker colored stool today so now I have bleeding in upper GI tract !!!! Lol. I’m miserable I hate this so much. I have anxiety attacks all the time I need to get out this health anxiety shit . Please someone tell me how I’m ok lol"
55,"Appetite issues and more, suspect it's stress and anxiety.",Anxiety,"I've been very worrysome for a long time now, I worry too much abiut anything no matter how much I'm told to not worry about it.

the other day, I experienced presyncope (near fainting, not the first time) and everytime I eat I feel like vomiting and have to distract my self, breathe heavily, lay down, look at the ceiling; my appetite changed too, I used to eat very often and now I'm eating around just twice a day.

I feel fatigued and heart weak, slow minded, sometimes I twitch and it's annoying.

Am I drinking coffee? yes, but it's better than going through withdrawal.

I've asked for help and usually none of the advice works (like breathing slowly and deeply) so I don't know what to do at this point, today I'm going to the doctor because these things are bothering me a lot but I don't want my mother to hear about how nervous or anxious I get."
57,I feel like my brain isn’t functioning,Anxiety,"Do you ever feel like your brain just isn’t working anymore? As if your anxiety has just short-circuited the whole thing? For example, I find myself zoning out during conversations. I will listen to someone talk for 10 minutes and not have a clue what they said. Today I was driving to a place I’ve been a million times and in the middle of driving, I forgot how to get there. In fact, I had other things to type and now I can’t remember what I had to say. I feel like I’m living in a fog and the only things on my mind are things that make me anxious."
58,"Constant wonky feeling in the head, need support",Anxiety,"Hey everyone, first post here on r/Anxiety but I need to talk about this, for close to 3 months now I’ve had this daily feeling of pressure in my head/behind my eyes and feeling not exactly light headed but wobbly, feeling disconnected from things and sometimes it’s so bad I have a hard time reading, I also hallucinate patches of colors and have constant visual snow.
The only thing that helps is exercise, caffeine makes it 10 times worse, I used to be terrified of it being a physical problem with my brain and I’ve tried seeking help at a medical center but I wasn’t taken seriously because they assumed it was just some Covid anxiety or whatever.
Anyone has any idea of what it could be ? Is it really just anxiety ? I haven’t felt like myself in months and I’m honestly really tired of it."
59,Skipping Class,Anxiety,"Hello! I’m new here. :)
As you can see from the title, I skipped one of my classes two times because of something that happened. Of course I was there during attendance, but I left immediately after. The reason for me doing this, which I never wanted to do because I’m a good student, is because we had to work in partners. Yup. Not groups, but partners. I’d rather work in small groups because then I wouldn’t have to initiate the conversation. I didn’t want to work with someone I didn’t know. (Mind you that google meets generates random partners in breakout rooms) I have major anxiety (I’m going to see a psychologist in a few days) so being forced to talk with people usually triggers me. Last week was the first time that I skipped class for this class. I didn’t skip on purpose, my internet went out so I obviously used that as an excuse to why I didn’t continue attending the class. Today we had to continue working on the assigned work. The teacher was asking who our partners were, I didn’t have a partner so I immediately turned off my wifi with no second thought and took a photo of my screen so I could send it to the teacher so he’d believe me. I’m panicking right now because the classwork is due today and I have nothing done because I have ni idea what we’re supposed to do. I don’t want to tell him the truth because then I’ll have to face the dire consequences. My anxiety has been killing me lately and I haven’t had a moment to rest in a while. Any advice on what I should do? This sounds stupid I know, but I just... :("
60,Am I experiencing panic attacks? Or is it something else?,Anxiety,"Hey everyone. New to Reddit here. I don't know where to start but I know I have to start somewhere. I will try my best to explain how I feel. First of all, i'll introduce myself. My name is Anthony and I'm 24 years old. I've been having some "" attacks "" or not sure if they really are attacks that I'm experiencing. I experienced my first attack back in 2015, I was playing video games when it happened, as I was playing I felt like I was going to pass out so I instantly went to the bathroom to try and calm myself down.. as days went by I didn't think nothing of it. But first let me say that before the attack happened, I felt totally fine, I wasn't mad, depressed, or anything like that. I was completetly fine. So anyways, fast forward a few days later I get the attack again, and the exact same feeling aswell, I felt like I was going to pass out, so maybe I thought there was something wrong with me so I decided to go to the hospital so they could do blood tests on me to see if anything was wrong and a few days later I got my results back, and again, I was completetly fine, so I thought that was strange. As time went by I got more attacks, and the more I got them, the more I started to feel more things if that makes any sense. Literally now when I get these attacks, I can feel them coming, before they happen I start to feel weird.. it's really hard to explain, like my body feels weird, sometimes I'll start to feel as if im moving like a robot or something or like waves going on in my head and then seconds later that's when the attack hits me, and when it does, I instantly get nauseous, I feel like im going to pass out, my heart starts to beat a little faster and I also get the chills all at the same time! And while the attack is happening, it makes me want to go to the hospital but I don't because I'm sure they will say nothing is wrong with me. Sometimes the attacks feel like deja vu because they always feel the exact same. It's never any different, it's never any better nor worse. It's just always the exact same feeling. But anyways, as soon as the attack happens, wherever im at, I instantly go to the bathroom and I splash water on my face to calm myself down, while trying to catch my breathe. I noticed that when the attack happens and I stay still, it feels so much worse, it's like if I have to move so it won't feel as intense. Each episode usually lasts about 5 seconds.. and those 5 seconds feel horrible.. After the attacks happen, sometimes im left feeling depressed because I ask myself why am I getting these for no reason? Also the attacks make me feel different, like I just don't feel like my old self.. It's like one moment I  feel good and then the next moment I will start to feel bad. Sometimes the attacks make me feel physically sick for a few hours, sometimes a day or two. These attacks used to happen about once every month, then every 3 weeks, then every 2 weeks and now it's every week.. Sometimes I even wake up to an attack while I'm sleeping. I've had anxiety for years now. There is also some days where I feel random andrenaline rushes, but I'm not so sure if that's part of the anxiety. I can feel relaxed doing nothing and then out of nowhere I will start to feel an attack coming, or even if I see certain movements on tv or while im playing a game, causes me to have an attack. I've never had a seizure and I don't have epilepsy. It's like anything now causes me to have an attack..I feel depressed because I don't know what's wrong with me.. it's now 2020 and I'm still getting these attacks to this day. I'm finally breaking my silence after 5 years, I've only told my family, and they think it's probably anxiety, and the reason for not saying or telling anyone is because I didn't know what I felt nor did I know how to put it in words and I didn't wanna sound like I was going crazy... For anyone reading this, I apologize if I'm all over the place or if I didn't make any sense in some parts but I just hope that there is someone out there who can relate to me and help me out. I am tired of getting these attacks for no reason and I just want them to go away because it's ruining my life.. I just want to feel normal again.."
61,I want a job but it scares me,Anxiety,"Sorry for the long post, but ever since the pandemic started, my anxiety and depression has been spiraling out of control. I barely leave my house nowadays and I haven’t attended my lectures and done any assignments in 2 months. All of my friends have moved to other countries for college and all I have here with me right now is my boyfriend. I spend the entirety of my days gaming and barely eating. I got a new therapist the other day and it has just hit that I’m ruining my life when I was talking to her about my routine. She and along with my boyfriend suggested that I get a job so I can leave my house more and have some social interactions. I would love to do that but I am anxious about so many things and it’s killing me.

So my whole life ive been a pretty sheltered kid. My parents did everything for me and I never knew how to do anything on my own like cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc until they sent me to study abroad 3 years ago. I have learned to do all those things now but I’m still very slow in general and that’s the problem. When put into a tough situation that I’ve never dealt with before my brain just shuts down. I stutter so much that I can’t even form a basic sentence or sometimes don’t even say anything at all. I am the complete opposite of flexible. I am scared that my slowness will not be accepted in the work environment. Also doesn’t help that I don’t have the greatest hearing in the world. Most of the time I just  pretend to understand  people even though I couldn’t hear them because I’m scared they’ll get frustrated if I keep telling them to repeat the sentence. 

I am an international student so my options are very limited and I can’t think of a job that would accept someone as slow as me. I don’t know what to do. I really want a job because I don’t want to live like this anymore, but the thought of having one gives me so much anxiety."
62,just need someone to talk to rn,Anxiety,"i’m feeling scared, worried, and tired but i can’t sleep again"
63,OCD,Anxiety,"Hi so I have ocd and I have been doing compulsions everyday for the past 4 years with lots of anxiety, and in the past few months I have had violent thoughts, common thought is grabbing a knife and stabbing someone I have grabbed a sharp knife to see if I feel any kind of emotion like guilt and I have never had a desire to hurt anybody close to me or anybody period, and I always search the web to see if I compare to a sociopath or a psychopath, I have always been known as a kind and loving kid, and it takes a lot for me to get mad. I don’t have violent outbursts, and growing up sad songs like lucid dreams by juice wrld would make me emotional and give me anxiety and recently I feel like I haven’t been feeling as much as emotion, am i a sociopath, I really don’t want to hurt anybody but I feel like I haven’t felt as much guilt about these thoughts recently, I experience happiness and some guilt I would really appreciate feedback:)"
64,Lost a battle today.,Anxiety,"Hey guys. Coming down from an anxiety attack so this is probably rambly af. 

This morning I had to drop my software bootcamp/class. I have been attempting to succeed there for a little less than a year now, but with everything being the way that it is, I'm not able to continue. 

My anxiety has been ramping up like crazy as I have fallen more and more behind. Finally I was issued an ultimatum by my instructors, and after mulling it over, I understand that it is in my best interest (mentally and emotionally) to leave. I have had nightmares every night for months from stress. I can't quit my job. So school fell by the wayside until I got so far behind I was never going to be truly caught up with my peers. 

So I had to gut myself basically and message my main instructor and tell her that this is not working for me. I hope there are some options going forward. I loved my class and my instructors too. They tried so hard to help me and I didn't let them and now I'm here. I wish I could do it all over again. But I don't actually know if I would be any better. 

Honestly I think stepping back from Big Goals and moving into a mindset of healing and recovery could benefit me. I have always wanted to push myself very hard. I hold myself to the same standard as everyone else even with my anxiety and depression. But it's taken so long to even get started working on those parts of myself. 

Right now I am feeling like an enormous failure that had once again disappointed the people who believed in me. That is a tough pill to swallow. 

Any advice, support, or virtual hugs would be appreciated right now. I'm feeling like scum of the earth and am going to have to wait until my instructors reply to know if I can ever try this program again or not. So all I can think about is how my dream/goal is destroyed, what will I do now? Thanks for reading."
65,Dealing with relationship anxiety to an extreme extent,Anxiety,"Hi, I’m 18, male, and I’ve really been struggling with anxiety related to relationships. In my past relationships, it latched onto distrust. Now, it latches onto the possibility of it not working out or get boring, and for the past 12 hours the possibility that what if I lose feelings has been flooding my mind, hurting the happy moments with her. This honestly started because she’s been saying “I miss you” a lot and I don’t want to sound generic so I try to think of different things to say and then the possibility popped in my head. I know I still have feelings for her, but it’s like my mind is asking for constant reassurance I do. What’s the best way to cope with this? This happens in every relationship I’m in so it’s not like my mind is telling me something, because I really do want to be with my girlfriend. It’s just this thought keeps looming in the back of my head of the possibly I have or will lose feelings."
66,I wrote a song for everyone who goes through anxiety,Anxiety,"[https://open.spotify.com/track/2171awHdwkz8GrxgpDWRkk?si=VjUkyaQrSmCCmGafuCHbuQ](https://open.spotify.com/track/2171awHdwkz8GrxgpDWRkk?si=VjUkyaQrSmCCmGafuCHbuQ)

This song is a musical translation of how I experience anxiety, and I hope it can give you some peace. Listen on headphones or speakers for the full experience.  
Let me know what you think!"
67,Having an anxious day today. Anyone else?,Anxiety,"I mean every day is an anxious day but I didn't sleep well last night so I'm having one of those days where I couldn't even wear the outfit I had picked out because it wasn't what I usually wear. And nothing I do is going to be good enough today, I can just feel it.

I can't wait to go home and climb back into bed."
68,"Does it (jobs/work, life) ever get better?",Anxiety,"I'm in my late twenties, and I was wondering from older people: does it ever get better?

I feel like I can barely handle the stress from day to day responsibilities I have this early in my career. I've been doing job applications and that alone has been causing debilitating panic attacks and depression. I can't imagine moving up in the workplace and being responsible for junior people, or the pressure of being thought of as senior/ an expert in the field. Does it get better or worse?"
69,Starting a new job tomorrow and I’m so anxious,Anxiety,"It’s my first full-time job related to what I think I want to do with my life, and I was so excited initially. But now I am overthinking almost everything from whether they will like me, whether I will be able to learn quickly, and even even the most inconsequential things like when I will be able to take a lunch break. 

Any tips to calm down and not stay up all night worrying?"
70,Sleep anxiety,Anxiety,"Every night I get extremely nervous that i won’t be able to sleep, does this happen to anyone else?"
71,DAE notice that when they try to control their anxiety it only gets worse?,Anxiety,I’m starting to realize this for myself. Acknowledging and ignoring anxiety seems to be the only answer for me. Hell I’m even getting to the point where I invite my anxiety because it’s going to show up anyway.
72,Anxious scratcher,Anxiety,Does anyone know how to beat the habit of nervous scratching ? I’ve gotten to the point where my chest and stomach( where I scratch the most) is developing dark dry spots. It’s my most effect coping method but it’s at the cost of my skin.
73,people don’t understand,Anxiety,"the most frustrating thing about anxiety is trying to explain it to those that don’t get it. 

people without anxiety don’t understand that some things that may seem easy and effortless for them, are an anxious person’s nightmare. for example, driving.

i have a difficult time driving away from my house. my safe place ykno. my friend lives 30 mins away. i have not driven by myself 30 mins away from my home. she asked me to. i said i had anxiety about it and couldn’t come. 
now she has an attitude with me and is acting like i didn’t wanna see her. i did. i just mentally and physically couldn’t.

shit sucks. it really does."
74,Had enough,Anxiety,"I've always had anxiety but 2020 has really made it come to a head. I lost my job due to covid layoffs in the spring and then got hired with what I thought was my dream job! However it quickly turned into my worst nightmare. Being remote and trying to learn a job (that turned out to be more complicated than I thought)triggered a massive tidal wave of anxiety that caused multiple panic attacks. I ended up having to be put on meds to get me through the day. 4 months in and it's only getting worse daily w toxic management. It's affected my sleep, partner, children, and general health. I've decided my life and mental well being are worth more and have begun the job search all over again...."
75,Left my zoom meeting,Anxiety,"I had a zoom meeting and we were only like 4 people including the professor. 

So since there weren’t many people I had to participate in the discussions even though I didn’t understand the topic :( 

It stressed me out so much that I completely left the meeting after 20 mins. I’m sure my prof has clocked that I left and everyone else too. I feel so helpless"
76,Do I have anxiety?,Anxiety,I keep on thinking about ways I could theoretically fuck up and will just start cringing. I also just wanna scream when that happens really loudly. I get the same reaction when I think about all the times I have fucked up in my life and I can't stop thinking about all those times. Also I can not stop thinking about school assignments all the time. I have a mini panic attack when I do and I can't seem to stop. I go to the bathroom a lot everyday just to get away from everything. I also repeatedly hit myself when I get stressed or worried. I just never feel good now.
77,What do you do when your cognitive distortions are proven true?,Anxiety,"Tldr: partner cheated on me, confirming many thoughts I’d labeled as distortions from my anxiety disorder. 


crossposting from r/CBT to hopefully get a range of advices 


I’ve always been worried my partner of 3 years was hiding things from me, and a lot was I thought based on insecurity. I’ve had dreams of finding him on tinder, obsessing over the belief he resented me, believing he didn’t really love me, that he was lying to my face about still wanting me just to make me feel better — the anxiety/ocd usual. I started challenging these and seeing them as cognitive distortions, getting over the fears a bit, in the process learning to trust my partner. I got better. 

Last week I caught him on tinder. He swears he didn’t do anything other than drunkenly message girls, but I realize I have no solid proof to trust this on, or any part of our relationship. But he now confirms nearly all the things I’ve been suspecting and blaming on my anxiety: the resentment, the tinder, the lust and longing, the spite, the lying. 

Conversely my confidence and self love has really risen since I kicked him out, but the panic is quadrupled. I’m waking from nightmares every night about terrible things, most centered around us, and I realize that because my old anxious suspicions were correct, I have no toolkit to talk myself out of spirals and panic anymore. 

As every action movie protagonist has ever said: I’ve never trained for this."
78,Anxiety is killing me!,Anxiety,"November 30, 2020.  


I feel so weak and vulnerable. I am writing this right now, as I am experiencing a major panic attack. I am alone at my house and I don't know If will survive this for another hour.  


I can't process my emotions. I might act impulsively and hurt myself. My life has turned into a daylight nightmare. I just like lying on my bed all day. I don't know even a single person who will help me out, or who will listen to me and understand my feelings. Why has been life been so cruel to me?

I am whimpering. It's like I am hearing voices in my head. I am feeling bereaved about a friend I lost last year. Am I slowly turning schizophrenic? I just don't know what can I to do anymore."
79,Chest anxiety vs stomach anxiety,Anxiety,"Does anyone feel the anxiety primarily in their stomach or in their chest? Because I've found that it's usually in my stomach, but recently it's been in my chest and I find that a little harder to deal with. (The chest anxiety usually only happens when I have a panic attack.) When I feel the anxiety in my stomach, taking a deep belly breathe kind of changes the physical feeling in my stomach so I can breathe it away, but the feeling in my chest is different and it feels scarier. Which makes sense, because stomach issues are usually minor and chest issues tend to be a problem, but I was just curious if anyone else experienced the anxiety like that and if anyone  had any tips."
80,My job is driving me nuts.,Anxiety,"I've never felt anxiety like I have in the past few days. I'm having a hard time at work with people misunderstanding my intentions and not listening or communicating to a degree that my relationships with my co-workers, my boss, and my lead is deteriorating. We've had so many arguments, and they never listen to anything im saying. I've had such terrible anxiety there, today I almost quit. There has been a lump in my stomach for days, I didn't eat today, and people keep thinking I'm angry when I'm just really going though some anxiety. I can't stop holding back tears all day. 

I keep wanting to tough it out and hoping things get better, but I don't know if I'll make it. I can't express and of this to my boss. He's the one that's really making me anxious, along with my lead. I don't know what to do, or how to handle it. Should I quit? Any advice?"
81,heart anxiety despite normal EKG ?,Anxiety,"I did an EKG at the doctors a few days ago and despite a high heart rate (due to anxiety about being at the doctor’s lol) everything came back normal. 

But I still worry something is wrong because I just don’t feel 100% heart healthy. Like, something still feels wrong...

Can a normal EKG rule out heart issues ?"
82,Nocturnal Panic Attacks,Anxiety,"Okay , I'll try to make this short. So, September till now I've dealt with a large number of life stressors. In mid September my best friend passed away due to a drug overdose. Then in October I was made aware that I need to move due to my home I'm renting being put up for sale . 

So yeah within this time I've changed my diet to help my stress and anxiety, which has helped a ton. My days are great pretty much anxiety free , but then comes the night . I get comfy fall asleep then hours later I'm awoken to me having a full blown panic attack , which lasts between 20mins-1 hour . 

This has turned into an every night occurence, I know I have a lot going on . But can anyone help me if they can relate or shed some light on how to prevent them . Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
83,Im so lonely and drunk hello,Anxiety,Tell me about your day
84,Feeling like an idiot! Started my new job today...,Anxiety,"And the induction is online based and to be done from home (which I knew it was online, but thought it I had to go in) and so I went in and they said it was to be done from home😣 nobody mentioned to me I could do it from home and I didn't want to assume, so just went in. 

Luckily, they set me up a computer here and so I'm doing it in an office, but feel quite anxious, like an idiot and just overall overwhelmed...on a 30 minute break now so just here waiting, but yeah, I'm feeling so stupid. I've already messed up and it's not even been a day!

Need some support if possible?"
85,question,Anxiety,anyone else has high heart rate when they wake up for like 5 minutes?
86,"Ok yeah, im freaking tf out rn (possible trigger warning)",Anxiety,"I'm just fucking scared rn, I just suddenly started feeling like something bad is about to happen and I got fucking terrified. I know its probably just anxiety, but what if it isn't, what if its intuition and someone I care about is in danger. I know that recently, my best friend went to the hospital for a mild infection, but im scared cuz what if she goes into sepsis and thats the bad feeling, what if its about one of my other friends, or my gf, wtf do I do, im fucking panicking rn, and idk how tf to stop if im just freaking tf out."
87,Any tips on how to deal with imposter syndrome?,Anxiety,"I have imposter syndrome about who I am as a person. I always doubt who I am and how I act, how I treat others. I’m convinced myself I’m a terrible disgusting person and that I can’t let anyone know. I also suffer from a lot of intrusive thoughts which adds to this a lot. I never feel genuine, even tho how I act is completely natural. Whenever I try to convince myself that this is the case I manage to tell myself how terrible I am. I can’t even spend time with my girlfriend without thinking that I’m lying to her and that I secretly don’t want to be with her. I love her so much and she’s my favorite person in the world and it crushes me that I think these things. Currently looking for a therapist but until then some tips would help."
88,Anxiety overriding my intuition.,Anxiety,"Does anyone else feel like they can no longer trust their gut feeling about anything because of anxiety?
I was offered yesterday the opportunity to do something quite unexpectedly. It was a situation where you have to take a bit of a risk. Every fiber in my body was telling me to say no. It felt as if my instincts were telling me to say no. I said yes anyway. I am so happy I did. Now I realize that was just anxiety,  it has been happening alot where anxiety is overriding my internal intuition and I don't want to go through life without being able to trust my gut feeling. It has made me miss some life changing opportunities. Any advice on how to tell the difference?"
89,Anxiety attacks,Anxiety,"I keep having what i think are anxiety attacks when im trying to work on my math course (it’s online) i just get so overwhelmed and flustered that non of it is making any sense, I get really mad at everyone around me even tho they did nothing wrong and i end up just starting into nothingness with my mind feeling numb and emotionless. I don’t know what to do about it."
90,Advice on making progress for a long term phobia?,Anxiety,"Has anyone had actual progress getting over a long term phobia? I’ve had anxiety for 15 years now and luckily made tons of progress with my generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and even a few phobias but I’ve had a phobia of storms since the very beginning and it has never gotten any easier. I know the most effective treatment is exposure therapy but this is really difficult to do with storms considering I can’t predict when they will or won’t be. Watching videos of storms doesn’t make me anxious so it’s not a good substitute either. It’s the only phobia that has always gotten worse, never better. Has anyone tried hypnotherapy? Or any treatment that helped with a long term serious phobia? Thanks"
91,School Anxiety,Anxiety,"Hey everyone! I hope ure day is going well!
I suffer from anxiety issues and have recently been having lots of school related stress. 
ISSUE 1: I have been in the top class my whole life and I am extremely worried that I will be dropped from it due to my mediocre report card.
ISSUE 2: During remote learning I wrote a story with my mates that had a very similar name to a teacher’s should I be worried if they find out?
Hopefully one of you can help.
Kind regards, 
Trezdog"
92,i don’t feel like my “trauma” counts,Anxiety,"when i was about 13 or so i visited a museum in a city with my family and went to use the bathroom on my own. when i had taken my pants off and sat down i looked down to see a video camera under the stall looking at me. i froze in fear and did not ever say anything after the fact. it’s been like four years and i fight with myself internally about it because i feel like it should not be counted as traumatic because other people have been through so much worse. it has definitely had very bad consequences but i still feel like it doesn’t “count”, hence the title.



edit: idk if this makes sense but yeah"
93,Anxiety/panic is driving me suicidal,Anxiety,"I have general anxiety disorder and I’m in the process of getting a panic disorder diagnosis. My anxiety is ruining every aspect of my life, good and bad. I’ve been having up to 5 panic attacks a day (sometimes even more) and my anxiety is THROUGH THE ROOF. I can’t live like this. I can’t function and my social life has been ruined because of this wicked disorder. Even in my own home which I view as my “safe space” has become unbearable with my anxiety. I’m barely sleeping, I’ve lost 20 pounds in two and a half weeks, and it’s making my bipolar disorder worse. I’m at a loss. Medications don’t work and I’ve done years of therapy but the skills I work on don’t work. I’m close to committing suicide as I can’t live with this fucking curse anymore."
94,Finally mustered up the courage and applied to grad school!,Anxiety,"I graduated from undergrad about 5 years ago and never got a job in my field. I was stuck working retail and feeling pretty crappy. I did a double degree in marketing and psychology and the plan was always to get a job in marketing, get some money and go back to be a counselling psychologist. Which clearly never happened.

To make a long story short, I have lots of anxiety which has made it super difficult for me to not only apply to jobs, but to be successful in interviews. I had a really bad interview experience shortly after graduating and the interviewer made me cry during the interview and I just lost all faith in my skills and abilities.

I gave up. I would avoid looking for jobs, if I did have the courage to apply to a job, I would have anxiety about the potential interview. I would have panic attacks before the interviews. I would feel myself shaking during interviews. It was just very hard for me to get over the anxiety. I even started going to therapy again to see if that would help me.

Avoiding the job search  was hard cause everyone around me didn’t understand the damage this one interview did to me. I felt like an imposter in all my other interviews and I just never felt good enough. Good old anxiety.

Then August 2020, I decided to ask for some help from my cousin, who is almost done a masters in psychology, to help me with the application process and just to see if this would even be a viable option for me.

So we started looking. It all started to look very possible, but I required to get some references from my old professors. Thats when the anxiety started up again. Would my professors from at least 5 years ago even remember me? How do I even go about asking them? What if they say no?

I was so nervous about this and its one of the main reasons why I hadn't done all this sooner. All those what ifs. All that anxiety talk.

Two weeks ago, I finally did it. I asked 2 of my old professors. Of course they didn't reply and that had me spiral a bit. I was then encouraged by my cousin to send a follow up email. I got the first response and it was a yes! The second one, not so much. She was skeptical at first cause i was asking so close to the deadline, but she made an exception for me.

After a rollercoaster of emotions and many panic attacks later, I have applied!

I DID IT! The thing that has kept me up for so many nights, all the anxiety and what ifs, and I finally over came it all.

I feel so proud of myself, and honestly I cannot wait to tell my therapist. I finally did something that scared me, and even if it doesn't work out, at least now I can say that I tried and I gave it my all."
95,Health anxiety and chest pains,Anxiety,"Hi there. I have a bit of a back story.  about 2 years ago, I had chest pains, all of a sudden. This was during night, and I got so shit scared I went to the hospital. Upon doing various tests and whatnot, they couldn't find anything wrong, such as heart problems or anything. They ended up finding that I had a chest infection, and when I initially had these chest pains, I got so scared, and suffered symptoms of a heart attack, such as shortness of breath, pain in arms, etc. Thankfully, there is nothing wrong with my heart to this day, it ended up being a chest infection and I was prescribed antibiotics.  

Just last night, I got some sensations in my chest, not pain per se, but rather radiating sensations, and this caused me to lose my shit. I started panicking and these sensations got worse, but I tried to calm down, breath slowly, and it went down. Even when my mind was calm, and I knew there was nothing wrong with me, I still kept on getting these sensations every sometimes few seconds to a minute. I know there is nothing physically wrong with me, that's confirmed by doctors. But how the fuck do I stop my body from doing this? Every time I get sensations in my chest, by body goes into flight/fight mode, and feels like I have this rush of adrenaline, even when I calm down, it's like my body is telling me I'm in danger. I could be lying down, thinking happy thoughts, then BOOM, I get these sensations. All of these panic attacks started to happen after the initial hospital visit. I've had these panic attacks a few times, and was wondering if anyone knows how to deal with them? 

Thank you."
96,Randomly feeling something’s off,Anxiety,"Hey guys, just wanted to know if this happens to someone else as well. 
I’ll just be minding my business, on my phone, taking a shit, watching something etc and suddenly I’ll literally feel a thought coming into my head “Something’s off” “You’re feeling off” “Something is wrong” “You’re feeling wrong” and then I’ll double back to see if something on social media that triggered me, but if there’s nothing, my brain will keep sending me “Something’s wrong” messages. 
Does anyone else also go through these random signals of your brain trying to convince you something’s wrong even though you’re not in an anxiety or panic producing situation?"
97,I think it’s time to start medication. But I’m afraid of losing myself. Can anyone relate or change my view of it?,Anxiety,"So this is... really weird. I know I shouldn’t not want to get better. But I am afraid of it. 

I’ve had anxiety for 9 years. It has shaped my adult life, everything I do. How I act, how I interact with people, the things I like. And the thought of my anxiety going away is like... a part of me vanishing? And that part has had a huge huge part in my life for 9 years? 

I’m scared of becoming a different person. I want to get better because my anxiety has run out of control recently (a quick peak on my post history will tell you) but I don’t want to lose who I am. You know? I know it may sound stupid and when I type it it totally sounds ridiculous. But my taste in music is like edgy, relatable emo/anxiety music that I feel in my soul lol. What if I can’t relate to that music anymore? What if I can’t relate to other people anymore that i used to be in tune with? 

I don’t know. Call me stupid but I don’t want to lose who I am. But I want to get better because it’s consuming my life."
98,I'm having an anxiety attack.,Anxiety,"Sorry for post this, but is late night here and I don't want to disturb my family. This comes and goes, I'm feel really bad and I know that this will ends eventually, anyway that knowledge doesn't help to much so I try to ""talk"" searching for some kind of vent out my stress. Thank you very much a whoever that read this. My best wishes and greetings"
99,My anxiety ruining good days,Anxiety,"Great weekend with my boyfriend, but he leaves, and immediately my anxiety is like ""he didn't really have a good time"" ""he only likes all the nice things you do for him"" and on and on, all these worries, insecurities. It's stupid sure, I know that, anyone would say that, I know it is. But my brain will insist,""is it really though?"" ""Maybe you're right?"" I wish I could just trust people,I used to, but so many people have abused it...it's so much harder now. The bad experiences, they've just fed into my anxious thoughts over the years."
100,My best friend left me.,Anxiety,"I knew she was having a hard time with her feelings, I knew some things from our past still hurt her, that our friendship was damaged since she left for the first time. I knew it. And I couldn't do anything about it.

Today she sent me a message. She needs distance, she needs to find her own path, our friendship hurt her, **I** hurt her. And I couldn't do anything about it.

I'm the worst friend of all times. 

I just wish her to be happy, to find herself, to stop hurting.

But I would loved to be part of her happiness. I guess I was too naive.

I miss her. I feel betrayed and really, really sad.

Sorry, just needed to vent somewhere."
101,It’s hard not to feel like an imposter when you have good days,Anxiety,I’m coming off of a major meltdown that started about a week ago that finally pushed me to seek therapy. Weird thing is that I’m feeling almost no anxiety/sadness right now. How do you keep yourself out of the “unless I’m hurting all the time I’m faking it” mindset?
102,How do I get out of this “Groundhog Day” feeling?,Anxiety,"I have a 24/7 general anxiety disorder and have accepted it but can’t get past that everyday feels the same and in a bad way. Same fatigue, same lack of drive, same constant stress.

I am in college (22) and struggling to do any work this semester. 

I feel like I’d love to be a real estate agent or a developer (down the line if I ever get an MBA). There just seems like there’s so much that I want to do that gets stopped by this impending feeling of doom.

Seeing people around me mature and change while it feels like I’m stuck in quick sand. I can’t really see anything that’s changed in my life in the past year+.

Have any of you fling hobbies or jobs to take your mind away from these demons? Any jobs you loved while in “college years” or even part time without a college degree?"
103,"Looking for advice, help, or guidance on benzo recovery.",Anxiety,"***First, I would like to clarify that nothing here (including comments) should be taken as medical advice without the aid and approval of a professional physician or specialist.*** *I'm just looking to understand my situation better by hearing any input or stories. It can be incredibly helpful to talk things out and to hear others, and I thank you for reading and/or participating in the discussion if you choose to.*

Long story short: I'm a relatively healthy male in his 30s, living in the US with lifelong severe anxiety and panic disorders. I've been diagnosed everything from having nearly every generalized anxiety-related disorder (OCD, PTSD, etc.), all the way up to manic depression (specifically, Bipolar II). I took meds for several years in my early twenties but ceased all prescriptions for about a decade. Two years ago it became too much to tolerate on my own, so I went back to my doctor again. After many, MANY different trial-and-errors, we finally landed on a regimen of Buspirone, a beta blocker (for essential tremor) and 1mg of clonazepam up to 3x daily. Most days, I'd average just one clonazepam. However, it wasn't uncommon to have a bad enough day to warrant the second or third dose, sometimes taking my full daily prescription's worth.

Naturally, the clonazepam's potency decreased drastically throughout the past two years and it led to taking more of it, more often. The classic story! After falling into abusive patterns from time-to-time (including sometimes foolishly mixing it with alcohol), I realized I had fallen into a vicious loop and was on a scary entrance ramp to a highway I did not want to merge onto. I was experiencing bouts of amnesia from time to time, I said and did things EXTREMELY unlike myself, and realized I wasn't too deep in where I could still change things on my own volition. So. I cold-turkey stopped taking the clonazepam (I know the taper method is the proper way to get off, but I felt disgusted and disappointed in myself and just wanted to stop ASAP).

It's been ten days today since I last took it, and it's been a horrendously horrible ride. All the hallmarks of withdrawal - impossibly awful sleep loss/disturbances, physiological effects, rebound anxiety/depression, the works. I've been able to muscle through it until this evening when I experienced one of the worst panic attacks I've had in YEARS. My wife and I agreed I should take 0.75mg of her Xanax as the attack was incredibly acute and needed to be addressed with something at least. My physician was unavailable this evening and still isn't aware that I cold-turkey stopped. I've improved a bit since, but still just trying to strong-arm the rest of the night and hopefully will get some rest soon.

All in all, I know there's a LOT of issues with my story and my game plan on getting off of it. After tonight's attack, I fully plan on talking to my doctor when they're available this week and figure out a better way to treat these issues with something less spooky, but I'm also curious if those who have gone through this sort of thing before with benzodiazepines have any stories, advice, or general knowledge you could share about your own experiences. Once again, I am not requesting nor advocating unlicensed medical assistance, I will work out decisions with my doctor - I just want to hear your stories or insight if you're willing to share. Thank you for reading!

104,Is anxiety a first world problem?,Anxiety,"I’m not trying to trigger anybody, I am just truly curious. I struggle with anxiety everyday so I know what it’s like. I was talking to my dad about it a few days ago, and he grew up in small town Oregon in an extremely poor household, and he was saying that anxiety wasn’t a thing for him or anyone he knew growing up. Mark Mansons book, “the subtle art of not giving a fuck” talks about this as well, and his take is that humans thrive off of solving problems, and when the brain has no rational problems, it starts creating its own. I just wanted to know what you guys thought about this and what experiences you may have with this."
105,Dealing with driving anxiety at night,Anxiety,"Hey first time poster here, just wanted to share and ask for some help really quick. So I've had ny driver's license for over 3 years now, and every single year i have had some kind of car accident. 2 in this year alone. Im terrified to drive alone and especially in the dark.

This Tuesday december 1st i know ill be closing at my work and it'll be dark when i come home. It's also supposed to be 27° (farenheit) that night so im afraid there will he ice on the roads. 

I know it may seem dumb but im already so scared to drove home from work that night Any tips, reassurance or ways to cope with this feeling would be greatly appreciated. &lt;3"
106,Suicidal and Self Deprecating,Anxiety,"I cannot look at myself and even begin to think I look okay. All I see is my stomach. Ever since I’ve had severe anxiety come back into my life, I’ve gained so much weight. I feel hideous, so I never want to see anyone. I already am anxious to leave the house bc of the pandemic and this is just added stress. I have no idea how my body looks anymore, I see it differently every time I look. I wonder if I’m pretty or average and my anxiety is ruining my perspective. I’m just assuming I’m hideous bc that’s what my mind shows me. 
I cry every night about my weight and have panic attacks through out the day about it. I can’t exercise due to a health problem I’ve had the last 6 months. I’m just stuck. I had an eating disorder earlier this year, and lost a ton of weight. And it feels like I went through all that for nothing. I’ve gained half of it back. I’m so embarrassed and feel like a monster. I often feel suicidal just thinking about how others view me. It’s so selfish, I hate it.

Please what do I do?"
107,"Blaming other things, myself and can’t find confident to continue drawing my comic. And realizes the problems come from past resentment toward my Asian parents teaching me.",Anxiety,"Notice: English is not my native language. So there will be alot of grammar issue.

I drew short webtoon comic stories about wholesome act from people's tweets or stories. People seems to enjoy it really much.

I blaming myself as not good enough compare to other comic artist. I blame to thing that if I have a tablet, it woukd make it much easier (bc I made my comic on phone with no pen). I blame my self for not getting much likes for my comics as equivalent to I did a terrible job.

When I start sketching outa new comic episode, I fell inadequate, my confident drop low. And I just can't bring myself up despite people said that they really like my comics and can't wait for new episode came out.

I think part of it because I never feel good enough from childhood until adulthood (now 20s). My parents never encourage or give any compliment for my drawing skills. They are typical Asian parent (and we aren't live in US) so they don't see any good in drawing at a career. 
 They always compare me to others, at how good they are and that I need to fell ashame for not doing as good at others kids. 

And if you are not good at them then don't bother doing anything.

It's really suck and frustrated. I just want to scream my loud it and talk back to them but that is an unacceptable and I will be look down on. 

They really taght me to listen to them at all cost. And they told me all the negative things about how incompetent I am and they expected me to be as good as I possibly can?!! When our relatives giving me a bad judgement about me in front of my parents. They didn't say anything back and just accepting that I am bad. What do you taught me is that I should not stand up for myself when others who don't know me and gave me a bad judgement. I should just keep quiet and accept that i am that bad person!

And what do my parents expect I am coming out of that teaching?!! A successful, confident woman?! Who doesn't need to stand up for herself when people have false judgement  about her, who just silently listen to what others has to said about herself and always accept that it's a right judgement about herself?!

It doesn't work like that, what it comes out is Me! An overly crippling anxiety , low confident , low self-esteem is what you will get! That's how your kid coming out when you taught her to not to fight back at others and your wrong judgement.

You taught us to listen to you and we Did listen to you! (All the Bad things that you told about us! Dear my Asian parent!)"
108,"Very fast heartbeat, what to do?",Anxiety,"I feel my heart beating very hard for what seems like the entire day. I already went to a cardiologist, he said that ideed my frequency is very high, and it must be ""just"" anxiety. 
Sometimes, mainly after I go through some stressful events, I feel palpitations many times a day for a few days at a time. Even when I'm laying down, near sleeping, etc. 
I think the palpitations and the high frequency of heart beatinga might be connected.

What should I do? Is this normal? Should I worry? I want to cry, really."
109,Am I the only one who is getting this?,Anxiety,"In October i became suddenly paralyzed, i was hospitalized and they told me it was low potassium, gave me some shots of it and sent me home. Ever since, ive had panic attacks every night sometimes multiple times. Ive been to the ER 3 times since convinced my heart was failing or I was becoming paralyzed again. I'm not sure what to do, Ive had every test available done to me and im still having heart palpitations multiple times every hour. Alot of my doctors say its from the anxiety and panic attacks but even in between the panic attacks im getting them. Does anyone else get frequent heart palpitations when theyre going through frequent panic attacks/ highly stressful situations??"
110,How long can I go without sleeping?,Anxiety,"I can’t sleep at all. I’ve only managed to get 1 hour of sleep tonight. Whenever I try to fall asleep, my heart starts racing and I get anxious which causes me to not sleep. How long can I hypothetically go without sleeping before going insane?"
111,How do you reduce anxiety at work?,Anxiety,"I can’t stop feeling really anxious about work, especially on Sundays when I think about Monday. Usually while I’m there I’m always worried that I’m just an annoyance and a bother to everyone there, even though no one has really said anything like that to me. I’m relatively new there (I’ve been there for 6 months, it’s also my first job), and I feel stupid whenever I ask something, even if the other person is nice about it. I dread going in some days because of all this.

Tomorrow has me worrying for a more specific reason,  but again it’s kinda minor and I shouldn’t be worrying about it but I still am. Any tips would be appreciated!"
112,My anxiety makes me feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff...,Anxiety,"Imagine that you are standing on an extremely high cliff, looking down. It’s absolutely petrifying, but for some reason you can’t move. 

But all of a sudden somebody nudges you, like they are pretending to push you off to spook you, so then you get this jolt where all your nerves are tingling and your heart is pounding.

Hopefully you know what I mean, because that is exactly how I’m feeling all the time. 

I am constantly having anxiety (I am standing on the cliff) - from the moment I wake up, to when I’m work, crying in my car home, and then before bed where I stay up until 3am in my own thoughts, finally I fall asleep but I only end up having nightmares. Rinse and repeat. 

It’s so mentally and emotionally exhausting. On top of it - something triggers my anxiety even worse (like that’s nudge on the cliff). It is so much easier said than done to just step away from that cliff, but for the life of me I can’t. I can’t make it stop. I can’t get out of my head."
113,I want to understand my partner more,Anxiety,My partner has mixed anxiety–depressive disorder and I have depression. I really wanna make this work and understand her more! Any tips or would anyone want to share their experiences? What can I do and what I shouldn't do?
114,Update to “unprofessional psychiatrist”,Anxiety,I’m getting a new psychiatrist finally!!!
115,So I broke down in front of everyone in my workplace,Anxiety,"Sooo, i'm on an internship at a corporate firm and i've been there for about 11 weeks, it's been hell on my anxiety but I've managed to control it... until hours ago. I've never had much experience working and i always struggled so long with my depression and anxiety. So, i just got lightly reprimanded by my manager and honestly he was very nice about it but the fragile emotional bonds holding me together was shattered instantly. I could not handle it... i tried to keep my emotions in check but I cried at my own desk while trying to keep quiet, i'm pretty sure i failed at it. Then i went to talk with a senior about some work and i couldn't stop crying. I was basically in the middle of the office, with high visibility but i couldn't contain it, tears just bursted out and honestly i don't know what to do. I'm embarrassed to even think about returning tomorrow, i'm embarrassed that i failed in trying appear normal and not such a broken human being. I left the office in a rush after and i'm just going to see a doctor to get the day off but what should I do about tomorrow... i'm not sure what to do when i return tomorrow..."
116,Anxiety after stopping medication,Anxiety,"I’ve stopped taking Venlafaxine/Effexor for about 6 weeks now after being on them for about 7 years. 
In the last two weeks I’ve had a lot of constant anxiety, nothing major but just constant anxiety. Should this subside? Is this just my body adjusting?"
117,Texting,Anxiety,"I get anxiety when other people text me, and i don't really like texting. Unless is with my ex ( which i still like). I don't feel anxiety with her.

Is it weird feeling anxiety for texting other people unless is your SO ?"
118,Best anxiety medicine with little side effects,Anxiety,I’m currently on anxiety medicine I’m 26 F and I’m on Viibryd. For the last few weeks I been experiencing stomach pains and dry mouth. also noticed some bad headaches too. Just wondering if there’s something out there with few side effects thanks in advance
119,Extreme guilt over leaving my job.,Anxiety,"So I have been miserable in my retail management job for a very long time. Its given me panic attacks, I cry when I get home often im angry half the time im there (my colleagues never see it i hide anger well) they treat us like crap, I've worked there for 10 years and I am most definitely still expendible to them. Money is more important than their staffs mental or physical health and there is so much misinformation and last minute changes. I just spent 2 weeks working in a closed store being given useless jobs like price changes no-one will ever see.  The problem is I love my staff, lots of us are friends and we are a great team. I have been to an interview for a much less stressful job and am desperate to get the job but the guilt of leaving my current staff, especially just before Christmas, is killing me. Im losing sleep, gaining weight and have a constant knot in my stomach. Im scared ill get this new job and not have the guts to quit where I am now. But if I do that then i feel like ill be trapped there forever. I dont know how to find the courage

Edit: thankyou everyone for the encouragement. I GOT THE JOB!!!!  So I handed in my notice today and the world didn't end."
120,My heart recovery is slow and it makes me anxious and scared,Anxiety,For example if I lift heavy weights for 5 minutes and my heart rate reach 170 bpm it will stay like that for 6-7 minutes :( it all happened 5 years ago when I let my heart rate go up to 200bpm while exercising and I just noticed my heart rate doesn’t want to slow down it was beating fast for an hour I thought I’m gonna die I don’t get it why my heart rate recovery is so messed up
121,Does this sound like anxiety?,Anxiety,"I will be calling my child’s doctor tomorrow, but I’m wondering if she has anxiety. Here are a few things she just told me, feel free to ask questions. 
-she’s 14, has an older brother (15), has a good relationship with him. Not overly close/best friends, but they share friends a lot so hang out in groups and enjoy each others company
-her dad and I divorced when she was 6. Fairly amicable, but he displays traits that are definitely consistent with narcissism and she has to see him every other weekend.  
-she has a very difficult time falling asleep most nights. Drinks no caffeine, eats a mostly healthy diet, is a healthy weight and she plays a competitive sport. She said when she tries to fall asleep she sometimes has visual hallucinations that get more vivid when she closes her eyes, so she tries to keep her eyes open as long as possible. 
-sometimes has tactile hallucinations during the day, like someone is tapping on her arms. Not sure if this is on days that she is sleep deprived or not
-has feelings of certain areas of the house being more safe than other areas. We just moved to this house a month ago, and she seems to love the house, had a part in choosing the house and chose her bedroom. It’s in a very safe, quiet area, so “should” feel safe all around. The areas that feel more unsafe are the areas with the most visibility to the street, ie windows that don’t have blinds or curtains yet. 
- I read a few posts and someone mentioned sighing and taking deep breaths  a lot. She does this, some times more than others, and has for several years. 
-is in honors classes and gets A’s and B’s. Her sport is more for fun, she does not plan to play in college and may not next season, even. She told me this and I fully support her, and she has always known that she can choose not to do it the next year."
122,Very early relationship anxiety,Anxiety,"So I have been talking to this guy for a little over two weeks now and we hit it off really fast. At first we texted daily and would sometimes call and play multiplayer games over the phone together. We ended up meeting and still hit it off and there was still plenty of mutual interest. I really like this guy. Most likely due to the sort of “honeymoon” phase of starting to talk/potentially date someone, I see few,if any, flaws in him. My problem is between past trauma and my general anxiety, my brain is constantly playing scenarios in my head of why he might be distant for a day or why he isn’t texting back. I don’t want to come off as some clingy person or anything so I try to not bother him too much. He also has anxiety issues and I don’t wasn’t to unload all this on him and cause him anxiety or even potentially scare him off. So I lay in my bad not able to sleep because of either my anxiety scenarios or fear that I’m bothering him and pushing him away. Anyone have advice on how to talk to him about this or what I can do to ease these random bouts of anxiety?"
123,Anxiety attack?,Anxiety,"Every time I think of something that makes me feel sad, and is related to my old school in any way (some times it’s not even related to my school) I get super anxious and that feeling last for around 5 minute. Sometime I breathe heavily and my hands start shaking, almost like a mini anxiety attack, idk what to call it. It’s not as extreme as a panic attack but still sucks. Is that normal ? And does this happen to anyone else ? Ik people go through more than what I am experiencing, and my problem might be nothing compared to other people’s 🤷🏻‍♀️. I just really want to know what this is , I have been experiencing this ever since I was in that school 3 years ago. I never thought I had any problems other than this, but when I think about it I do show a lot of signs of social anxiety but not as severe I guess."
124,How can I turn awkwardness into confidence?,Anxiety,I’m a super awkward person who stutters and has social anxiety. My youth pastor is kind of awkward but he does it with confidence if that makes sense? I try to hide my awkwardness which makes me more awkward where he fully owns it and tried to be as awkward as possible. Idk how to describe it or even if this makes sense. But how can I turn my awkwardness into confidence? I want to do that
125,A couple encouraging words would be super helpful,Anxiety,Health anxiety sufferer. A bit anxious about going into college today incase I get a headache in school/get sick. Some encouraging words would be super helpful right now please
126,Medication that isn't an SSRI or antidepressant??,Anxiety,"I have a mood disorder, so any ssri's will send me straight to crazy town lol. Are there anxiety medications that aren't antidepressants?"
127,Anxiety/Drunk,Anxiety,"So when I hang out with my boyfriend and his friends they don’t really talk to me especially this one girl who barely says a word to me. But once they’re all drunk they start talking to me and it kind of hurts my feelings as if they don’t want to talk to me unless they’re drunk. Note I worked with these people and I met most of them before I met my boyfriend at the time. I just don’t get it, any ideas? I question myself a lot though and my mind plays tricks on me it feels like now. I’ve been through a lot in the past year and my mind is constantly saying I’m not good enough or I’m
Not funny these people don’t want to be around me. But at the same time I feel everyone’s vibes and yeah we can say this girl is “shy” until she’s comfortable, but I’ve talked to all of them MULTIPLE times. I always feel left out and I text these people and they end up ignoring my texts."
128,Huge Anxiety/Panic Attack Need Help,Anxiety,"30 M here with a partner I love very much, a 6 year old stepson and a toddler of our own. This weekend (Saturday morning) my anxiety was through the roof and things set it off and before I had a chance to set away or take a deep breath I lashed out and went off on my partner, her brother who is living with us and our two children were right there in front of us. 

My partner and I have been struggling lately. I stopped going to therapy in March when everything went telehealth. And I was on a low dose of Lexapro but I struggled with the side affects and had to stop use. I’ve messed up many times since I’ve stopped therapy. She says she’s pretty much done and my apologies mean nothing and nothing will get better until I get help. I slept on the couch last night and looks like I will be again tonight. I’m a wreck, was a mess all day today and yesterday and feel like I’m helpless. Constant sighing, crying, depression. I’m ashamed and embarrassed of myself and worst part is my therapy isn’t until Thursday evening. I need help now, I’m hurting so much and my anxiety is destroying everything I love in life.."
129,Tips for managing overstimulation at work?,Anxiety,"Overstimulation has become a big problem for me at work. I work at Starbucks, in a small drive thru only location. There’s 6 of us in there at a time, and no customers are able to enter. Lately at almost every shift I become overstimulated and my chest starts to hurt and I feel like I can’t breathe. I have to take my headset off. I feel like if any were to brush past me or touch me I’d lose it. It’s too loud, I’m going too fast. My hands shake and I can’t hold onto drinks. I feel made and irritated and like I need to be the only one making drinks because everyone else is in my way. 

I’m currently on 10mg of lexapro, and that’s helped me with my social anxiety and allows me to stand up for myself and be more confrontational and confident. I just have no idea how to handle these bouts of overstimulation and irritability. Any advice is welcomed. Thanks!"
130,"GAD and hypersensitivity to noise, anyone?",Anxiety,"I've had GAD with dissociation episodes pretty much all my life, and I'm used to the rollercoster vibe of it. I'm hypersensitive to noise, which I manage although one thing I still can't manage, and that is highly debilitating, is that I can't stand noise made by people's voice, especially the voice of my loved ones. 

It's making me very very irritable, and well, I really don't want to silence anyone, it's opposite of my values. It's absolutely living hell with my boyfriend, sometime I snap at him for talking to me or trying to make me laugh, and then I go isolate for hours and have a little panic attack for myself because I can't stand being this way. He thinks he is to blame which is absolutely not the case, I feel absolutely horrible. I don't want to live my life in silence, that's crazy.... 

I've also quit many jobs because of it. I would be in the middle of a task and then need to go home because the noise from people chatter made me dissociate. 

I'm the same with touch. Which again, sometimes makes being in a relationship with me very difficult. 

I even wondered if I wasn't on the autism spectrum or anything (which my therapist absolutely comforted me in saying that it isn't the case). 

Anyone feels the same? Anyone have some advice?"
131,Does anybody have this ?,Anxiety,Hi guys hope you are well. Sometimes my body feels like it’s moving. It’s usually my lower back and leg area feels like they are swaying or moving forward and backwards.
132,does anyone else feel overly anxious in front of coworkers/at work?,Anxiety,"I started a new job last week and I've been spending the most time I've spent around people in almost half a year due to the rona completely screwing up my social life, being around people has made me realise how much my social skills have deteriorated and how truly awkward I've become, basically I don't know how to handle a conversation anymore and it's showing, sending me into a downward spiral of continual anxiety over feeling like I'm being judged in my interactions with them, does anyone else struggle with this?does anyone have any tips for overcoming it?"
133,"Someone i barely know passed away, anxiety and nightmares for days",Anxiety,"A few days ago, I found out my friend’s dad passed away from liver issues, right after i got the news of him passing my anxiety got worse. my heart’s been beating really fast and i’ve been having nightmares for 4 days straight (i barely dream) and the nightmares are so bad that i wake up in tears. I’ll wake up at 4 am fall back to sleep and wake up at 5:54 am to another nightmare. In one dream an aunt i dislike got the same liver issues and passed away, when i woke up i was panicking and thinking about how i should be more understanding towards her even though she’s a bitch to me. 

it’s because i got the news about my friend’s dad’s death. but i’m not even sure why i’m upset, i met the guy maybe 2 times and barely knew him. but lately i’ve been thinking about how many difficulties my friend and her family will be facing without her father who was the main earner of the house and also how he was a really really nice guy he worked with my dad on a project once too and my dad said he was such a gentleman. it just sucks, it’s always the good guys who pass away first. there’s so many shitty and selfish people in this world but it’s the hardworking and selfless people who die. 

i hate that this anxiety worsened when my 4 day break from school began, it was barely a break because of my anxiety. i also had a lot of work to catch up with during break but guess who couldn’t concentrate? me."
134,Work induced situational anxiety - destroyed my life? Am I stuck in this loop forever?,Anxiety,"I have worked in a very stressful industry for about 8 years and several years ago I was “thrown to the wolves” by my terrible bosses that resulted in me having to “wing it” or “fly by the seat of my pants” with clients on major dollar projects.

Long story short when I first got into this industry my bosses were terrible and offered zero guidance and I think it’s given me a permanent condition that I cannot seem to overcome. I was dumped onto massive projects with absolutely zero managerial oversight/ or experience and had some pretty crazy ups and downs during this time. I’d have straight up panic attacks in business meetings with a dozen people in them. I’d keep it together and bulldoze through the meeting but physically it would be obvious I was having severe anxiety issues. Extreme sweat, trembling hands, fumbling words, etc. very embarrassing. 

Fast forward 5+ years and I’ve still never overcome this. I can go into a business meeting with a client I’ve known for years and it’s like I’m in 8th grade giving a speech to a class without my pants on. 🥴

I’ve tried: lexapro, Xanax, Effexor, alcohol (lol), THC, CBD, some therapy. 

It’s gotten to a point where I experience this half the time in my own office when speaking to my boss. Wtf!? 

Only things that seem to work are unhealthy alternatives. Xanax only works if i take 2.0+ mg and it causes me to black out. Alcohol isn’t a healthy alternative and is out of the question. 

Anyone else experience this? Anytime I’m near my boss or clients I am a different person. Timid, anxious, panicked, on edge, sweaty, etc. 

Any suggestions? Ready to quit my job at this point.

Edit: I eat a healthy well balanced diet and exercise 5 days a week. Forgot to add that in"
135,What supplements actually made a difference for you ?,Anxiety,"Let me know, everyone says magnesium, but I’m not sure how that works like how to take it ? I take a multivitamin and fish oils but I want to start taking more for my anxiety. Thanks"
136,DAE feel like their brain gets hot when they have anxiety?,Anxiety,I feel like my brain is stuck in fight or flight. I keep getting waves of adrenaline in my abdomen and the top of my brain feels like it's on fire. It is so uncomfortable and I don't know how to make it stop.
137,"When I am bored, my brain runs wild...I literally can’t relax!",Anxiety,"I am a 31F (which I already feel way too old on this subreddit - I feel like no one my age deals with this) but my anxiety has hit a new level postpartum. When I am busy, I am obviously productive but I am happy and my anxiety is relatively at bay. The second I have nothing to do I can’t just relax, take a bath, unwind, etc but instead my thoughts run wild. I think about my parents dying, what I will do with all of their stuff, how I will survive without them, etc. My body trembles, I start a mild sweat, I sometimes cry, it just becomes overwhelming. Between the pandemic, a shitty job, poor finances because of said shitty job, the stress and anxiety of a new child (my first), and the list goes on I just can’t seem to shake this anxiety. I sought help and am on meds (welbutrin and ativan) but they don’t seem to help much. Therapy wasn’t helping either. I just wish I had one damn person who could say they understand how I feel."
138,Seeking Support Group,Anxiety,"Hi there I’m a 24 year old female who has struggled with anxiety my whole life. Recently my anxiety has reached a whole new level, I had to leave my university because I was too afraid to go outside or to class. In class I would have panic attacks and it was terrible. I also passed out while driving during a stressful time and ended up in a small creek. I thank the universe every day I didn’t hurt anyone. Some nice man crawled through the mud to get me out of the car, and a nice lady held me while I was hysterical. I got a job in Portland Oregon and a studio, and i went right back to self isolation and was fired right around the time COVID started, so I moved back in with my parents. I have really started thinking about why I am the way I am, and I realized some pretty fucked up shit happened when I was a kid. My parents aren’t to blame but they are in some ways responsible and it has effected my relationships with peers, friends, teachers. I’m avoidant and have so much anxiety about even asking for help. I go to therapy once a week and have a doc for med management but I’m looking for any kind of group that relates to what I just wrote. I’m in Portland, but COVID. So online groups are a good place to start. Please leave your thoughts and reccomendations! Thank you."
139,If they only knew,Anxiety,"Some times I feel like I know you and with a blink of a eye your gone transform to a yes man or a teachers pet have me witness this and I’m sorry if I call you out on your bullshit but this cringe feeling in stomach it starts to turn into anxiety when logic and reasoning don’t work, now I start question why I came here as the time passes every sec that passes by adds ten times to my anxiety ,now I look calm but In my mind I’m so much closer to insanity so much that I feel the sweat forming on  my forehead and under my nose I wana run out the door but that seems like it would make things worse so I ask if we could go but you say in a little bit if you only knew how much is that asking of me at this moment because my anxiety is getting the best of me so trie to smile and trie not to puke drink some water trie to breath then you ask me to put in effort to to enjoy my self if you only knew the hell I have to endure."
140,Anxiety and gluten intolerance?,Anxiety,"Hey guys so I've (20M) been dealing with a lot of anxiety in the last year and it has been getting worse. Well, this week I went to the doctor and found out that I have low iron levels and a high potential of being gluten intolerant. Does anyone know if gluten intolerance can feed into anxiety, or if they have any connection? I know I can search this myself but I'm looking for experiences. Thanks"
141,i want a mind i control - replyhazy,Anxiety,"i shouldn’t fear a knock at the door,
it’s not like i’m here anyway

https://youtu.be/oZNl08SdAhc"
142,Is This Anxiety Related?,Anxiety,"I’m a college age student who has been diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve always been really good at school and had am currently attending a top university in my state. While grades have never been an issue for me, extracurriculars and forming professional relationships has always been a struggle. I’m an extrovert and have never had any issues making friends, although i would say i have some social anxiety around people that i’m not that close to. 

I feel like I’m so close to having what it takes to become successful but this one thing is holding me back. I’m pre-med and have the grades and test scores to get into med school, but my resume is still lacking. It’s nearly impossible for me to get myself to shoot an email to a volunteer coordinator, or a doctor i’m looking to shadow under. In person I have no problem asking for these things, but when it comes to emailing, texting or even worse calling, it’s like pulling teeth. This also applies to situations such as asking a girl on a date over text. I’ll pick my phone up and stare at it, wondering what to say. Usually I end up saying nothing. How do I fix this? And is this related to my ADHD? I’m worried it will derail my career plans and it’s really taking a toll on my mental health."
144,Anxiety with looking for a job...it's my first time encountering this type of dilemma and i can't handle it.,Anxiety,"I had GAD and panic attacks but i've managed them well in school. Now that i'm done...and is job hunting, everything feels...awful. It's not that i was a bad student, my grades are okay, it's just that it's my firts time applying for a job related to my degree and it's making me very very anxious. You see,in my field..it's either you're 100% sure of where you're going after, where you wanna apply and all that or you gotta accept you'll float from place to place for a time while looking for the one that fits you. It's hard to explain while not mentioning it so i'll just say i'm in healthcare and i'm newly licensed. 

It just dawned to me that i should've prepped myself prior, that i should've been more friendly to my seniors in order to make more connections, i was friendly but i just don't put myself out there. I feel terrible. All of my friends...seems to know what to do after, while i...i have a slight idea but i dunno if it fits me and what sucks is that the pandemic messed up everything. The slots were mostly taken because the licensure examinees passed in just a space of 1 mo. Our slots...might be already filled in. The application period ended waay back when i was in review period, and what should i do? 

Plus, my parents seems to be very positive about me, asking me this and that (dude i just passed the exam not more than a month ago, gimme a break) . Suggesting places and all. Dude, i am not even sure yet that a place will freakin accept me. Theyre asking me to message  one of the people we know (but i barely talk to) and ask for help. I hate asking people for favors. It feels awful. But i can't procrastinate because the time is running :( idk what to do..."
145,Anxiety buddy,Anxiety,Because no one around me suffers from anxiety or panic it’s hard for them to understand me. I’d love to have someone to talk to who knows how crap this all is!
146,Weird dizzy sensation upon sharp head movements,Anxiety,"So I sort of have this mild disorientation feeling that I’ve been dealing with for about 6 months now. I’ve gone to the doctors to rule out anything related to the ear or blood/heart. It’s a very weird feeling, and it’s constant. It does wax and wane, which keeps me hopeful that it’s anxiety. It’s almost like I’m dizzy, but not truly dizzy. I also have mild headaches daily pretty much. I can keep my balance on command, but I just seem vaguely motion sick all the time. Particularly, I have a problem with fast head movements. It’s like my eyes are slow to react. I’ve had a VNG, so it’s nothing vestibular. This is the only presenting symptom of my anxiety, and it’s got me questioning if it’s anxiety at all. Then again, I’ve been to the doctor a bunch, and they haven’t found anything. Is all this stress?"
147,DAE get a sharp tingly feeling at random times?,Anxiety,They’re kinda like pins and needles minus the numb feeling that usually comes with them. I don’t exactly know how to explain it but recently when i get that nervous feeling that’s followed with a shiver they spike up all over my back and chest and they really hurt. Like a lot. I just wanna know if this happens to anyone else or if google is right in saying i’m dying and i should start prepping my funeral.
148,Separation anxiety,Anxiety,Anyone have more anxiety when their spouse or significant other is out of town? I hate it especially since he has been home so much from covid it makes it harder when he is gone.
149,"my worst fear is never getting out of dead-end job hell, and it's ruining my life",Anxiety,"I just realised something a little while back. I have never had a proper job in my life. Not once. It's all been dead-end meaningless part time jobs. Nothing I'm proud of and nothing that will take me anywhere in life. I'm 24, and while some may say that's still young, it's causing me a lot of stress. I'm worried sick that this will be my life forever. Always getting stuck doing these part time bullshit jobs because I 'don't have enough experience' for anything better. Even when I apply for a position that perfectly fits my degree and experience, I still get the same feedback. I think about this every day, and at night I often cry myself to sleep about it. I'm just so terrified of never achieving anything worthwhile in life. I'm so done doing jobs I don't care about, putting up a fake smile to rude customers, being a total doormat just so my boss won't fire me, etc etc. I'm so sick of it, and so incredibly unhappy. Yet I can't get out. I just don't know anymore..."
150,I hate that I'm no longer high functioning,Anxiety,"Ever since I was a teen, I thought there was something ""wrong"" with me. I've always known that I was an anxious person. However, I always performed well in school and was able to get by in life decently, so I figured it was nothing serious enough to pursue. However, 2020 has thrown that completely out the window. There are multiple things that have happened this year, and I felt like I was struggling each step of the way. But I was still holding it together. I was able to perform really well during my summer internship at a prestigious, household name company. I was almost certain that I was going to get a return offer, where I will start a full-time employee with them next year after I graduate. In fact, if it wasn't 2020, that's exactly what would have happened.

But the company only had room for a few select interns due to COVID, and I didn't make the cut.

My depression and anxiety were destroying me before I got the news that I wasn't getting a return offer, but now it's even worse. Beforehand, it was difficult to get out of bed. I would do my Zoom classes or my work meetings in bed, with my camera off. I'd put in the bare minimum work. I'd sleep for as long as I could, take in naps. Now that I've gotten the news, I'm just in a constant state of worry.

Worried that I'm not going to pass my classes this quarter because I can't focus long enough to get any work done. Worried that I'm not going to find a job. That I'm missing every opportunity. That I need to do XYZ things in order to obtain XYZ benefits. For a few days, my anxiety cancelled out my depression and propelled me to get a lot of work done. Now I'm stuck in a procrastination loop. 

Any time that I'm not actively distracted by something (i.e. hanging out with my new boyfriend, hanging out with friends, playing video games, etc), I feel like I'm drowning. 

Before 2020, before so many things in my life changed, I felt that I had a firm idea of what my future was supposed to look like. I specifically planned it out and crafted it to be this way. Now I have no idea what my future will look like, and I can't handle it. 

I used to be able to manage my anxiety to a point where I performed well. I excelled. I was a role model. Now I feel like I'm failing.

I miss succeeding. I miss having the energy to accomplish things. I miss not feeling fatigued after an hour of doing any work.

Sometimes I just want it to end. This constant state of turmoil is so exhausting, I don't know how much of it I can handle."
151,Thoughts during a panic attack.,Anxiety,What are your thoughts during a panic attack ?
152,27f open to friendship,Anxiety,"Hello, i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and major depressive disorder.

I’ve used behavioral activation over The last couple years and I’ve made a lot of progress. I’ve read that friendship is very good for anxiety… Unfortunately LOL. Because I’ve honestly always struggled in that department.

So this is me trying. I want to be a better person, and a good friend to people. Please hit me up if you’d like to chat :)"
153,Did I mess up or is it just my social anxiety?,Anxiety,"So today at church my youth pastor wanted me to help him. After the worship team was done and he was talking he wanted me to set up his table and a few props he had. It was a salt shaker, a bag of fries, a bowl of salt, and a light. I brought it all up to him except the light, my mind spaced the light and I forgot. So once service started he had to walk over and get the light since I forgot. I feel like I messed up as a leader and now he won’t want me to help. Am I obsessing to much about this? Does he realize it was just a simple mistake? Did I screw up? I always wanna do perfect and that results in doing worse"
154,I just need some support maybe..?,Anxiety,"my anxiety is at an all time high right now. quarantine has been making me feel panicked and death has been on my mind a lot. i just need some support, words of encouragement maybe? i feel very alone and none of my friends and family really understand the feeling i’ve been feeling."
155,Starting a New job with terrible imposter syndrome,Anxiety,"I’ve been out of work for nearly 9 months because of COVID. Before this I was working my first “real” job out of college for only 6 months. I worn as Social Media Marketer and it’s all very independent work. 

I landed this new job after months of applying working for a cool company, making 7 dollars more an hour than I did before, and it seems that I’m going to have a lot of creative freedom. I should be happy about getting this new job but I am TERRIFIED and slipping into terrible anxiety that’s causing panic attacks I haven’t had for years. At my last position I was on a team of 3 people and was given some direction. At this new job, the boss is leaving everything completely up to me (I’ll be a one man department) and I’ll have to manage a budget, contracts for influencers or brand deals, and create the entire direction for the companies social media branding. I feel that this is WAY above my head even though the owner seems very confident in me. I suddenly feel like such an imposter and like I’m going to not only let this guy down but myself and my family. I’m 24 and have never had this much responsibility and I’m so scared to ruin this opportunity. 

I want to be able to be happy and excited for a job that I know is a great opportunity and I know this anxiety can turn into a self fulfilling prophesy. Anyone relate to this?

TLDR: starting a new job with way more responsibility than I’m used to and feeling like a fraud. Help."
156,Presentation of anxiety,Anxiety,"I feel like my anxiety presents differently than everything I've heard about anxiety, and its just such a strange feeling to me and wonder if anyone is the same way. I wouldn't say my anxiety stops me from living my life for the most part. I do have some social anxiety in new situations and hate being the center of attention, but I wouldn't say my anxiety is debilitating or anything.  I've started to get random short panic attacks (I didnt know thats what they were until my therapist told me thats what they probably are) where my heart races, I have to take a lot of deep breaths, I usually laugh and then randomly start crying, but then it passes. And like it comes out of nowhere a lot, not necessarily because something triggers me. Anyone else like this?"
158,My mind tells me it’s not serious but my body be like.,Anxiety,"Nope this shit is for real and my mind is like “real shit?, hyper fight or flight mode activated”. 

I’m so tired of having a panic attack because my body feels one thing it’s not used to feeling. One missed breath and now I’m wondering if I am breathing properly. Swallowed spit the wrong way? “Oh shit I’m choking?”.

It’s been 15 years with general anxiety disorder and panic disorder 10 years diagnosed and I still can’t find anything better than beer/alcohol to to stop the symptoms. Benzos do little for me and I avoid them so I don’t become addicted to that as well."
159,Need suggestion,Anxiety,"Suffering from severe anxiety due to rejection, family problems, toxic and narcissist parents. Need your suggestion very badly. Help! 
Will really greatful if you help. I am suffering a lot."
160,"Dull chest pain, left side.",Anxiety,"It’s feels like a pinched nerve due to bad posture most likely but damn it when it comes the same doom like feeling also creeps in.

Cold sweat, etc. 

Took my vitals and everything is normal.

120/75 BP
HR 110-98 elevated probably because of impending or previous anxiety attack. 

Just posting to let out my fears. Otherwise if I tell my parents, they’ll probably yell at me for overreacting again. Lmao."
161,To the random people scrolling through the subreddit....,Anxiety,"if you're feeling stressed out, take a break, get a sip of water, and get the rest you deserve.

if you're feeling depressed, remember that there are resources that you can use to ask for help.

if you're feeling angry, take a breath, maybe take a hot shower, and then get the rest you deserve.

if you're regretful, let go of the mistakes you made in the past and focus on how you can improve in the future.

if you're feeling lonely, remember that there's always someone there.

if   you're stressed out about school and homework, ask for help from the   teacher, stop procrastinating on homework, and get the rest you deserve.

if  you're feeling suicidal, remember that you are special and that you  have a purpose, and remember that it's okay to ask for help.

if you're worn out or tired, grab a blanket and some hot cocoa, and get the rest you deserve.

if you don't like the way you look, remember that you're perfect just the way you are.

if  you are any these things, remember that you are amazing. Remember to  love yourself. You are special, amazing, and talented. You are unique.   You are a snowflake; there are never two same snowflakes. Love yourself.   Be kind to others. And if something is bothering you, what is it?

Edit: Omg I didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you so much for all the support and awards! I'll try to get back to all of you who commented."
162,Has anyone watched this?,Anxiety,https://youtu.be/ZidGozDhOjg
163,messed up after seeing a video,Anxiety,"okay first off, tw. this mentions a lot of disturbing stuff about a super graphic snuff video from an actual murder 

background i’m 15f and have seen similar things before (like surgical videos or the ronnie mcnutt video) which have messed me up a bit after, but this is the worst thing i’ve ever seen. the other day me and my girlfriend watched a documentary called dont fuck with cats about a man who killed someone, did various messed up things to his body, and filmed and uploaded it. i got morbidly curious and looked up the video. and no i’m not going to tell you the details because i’m not gonna enable someone else going through what i did, if you’re really that curious find it urself. i didn’t watch the whole thing but i skimmed thru it and saw a few frames. i’ll describe vaguely what i saw next, so TW. there was murder, dismemberment, decapitation, and necrophilia. and fuck i feel so wrong after that. i saw it yesterday and just tried to get it out of my head but often when i go through something like this i look for posts like this with ppl talking about their experience with the same thing bc it makes me feel less alone/like i’m doomed, because if other people survived it then so can i. but anyways, during that process i found someone describing the video in even more detail and it just brought it all back. and god i feel sick to my stomach. it wouldn’t be as bad if i didn’t know the background of it, or if it was even real, but i know every detail about this video and incident because of the documentary. i know who the killer was, what he was like and his motives, i know about his family and what prison he currently is in and how he got caught, i know who the victim is, how he looked when he was still alive, how his family grieved him, i know when and where it happened, all that. the documentary shows you pretty much all the evidence that there was. it gives you a real view into the situation, as if ur experiencing it urself. and all that just reminds me how it’s so terribly real. that really happened. and besides the obviously disturbing content it makes me so emotional because the victim was a good person. and the killer only did it to get attention to himself because he’s a fucking narcissistic psychopath. and i’m just so disturbed. i’ve been dealing with intrusive thoughts that i want to be like him or that i want to hurt people close to me. and i’m just so scared. last night i had an anxiety attack because i couldn’t stop thinking about it and seeing the images when i closed my eyes. it got so bad that i started seeing my girlfriend in the victims position and i couldn’t stop crying. i just really wish i hadn’t seen it and needed to vent about how it’s been affecting me."
164,Anyone willing to talk in dm’s?,Anxiety,"My anxiety has been pretty high recently. I feel like talking to someone that goes through the same thing that I do would help. If anyone is wants to talk, feel free to direct message me."
165,Burn out/ vent,Anxiety,"I legitimately haven’t felt this bad since 3 years. I always try my best to be the positive one regardless of everything because I find it helps me feel better too. I am so very thankful for everything that I have but I feel bad when complaining about the things I have to do. I feel bad because everyone worries for me and I don’t want them to be sad over me. I just don’t know what to do with myself, having high functioning anxiety is a curse. I get things done but I’m never satisfied and there’s always something that sucks. I wanna yell at every professor I have because I’m so frustrated at how everyone pretends to be nice but isn’t considerate or doesn’t adapt to the whole online learning thing. I don’t understand how I do my work and your work and pay more than normal only to feel this crap about everything I do. I feel like I’m submitting things to submit them, without learning. I have finals coming up now and it feels like I just will not get past because there’s simply no resources to. I usually like to depend on people for emotional comfort but I realize that, that is toxic to some people and I don’t wanna just have someone around to depend on. I want to depend on myself instead of having a token person to throw my problems onto. It’s really hard though and I’m just sat there wondering what to do with myself"
166,"""The Impossible Task"" and cleaning up around the house",Anxiety,"I've been struggling and struggling with cleaning up my house. I cleaned my bedroom for 10 minutes in the dark last night after a jag of random manic inspiration. Then I thought, ""I don't need to stress about it for a month"". In the daylight, I can see that I didn't really get a lot done. I'm stuck this way.

I feel like I tidied my slightly messy bedroom to avoid the actual problem; the rest of my house. There's broken glass *everywhere*, clothes, hundreds of pieces of unopened probably-important mail, empty wine bottle graveyard, trash. I just get so fucking stressed out and panic. Is anyone else dealing with this?

Recently there was a bat stuck in my house for 2 weeks. I was screaming my head off and tossing random things at it, to try and get it to fly away. My living room floor is still littered with all the things I threw at it."
167,Anxious or depressed,Anxiety,"I am less anxious, which means I am more depressed. It’s usually one or the other, but sometimes I get lucky enough to have both simultaneously.  I’m currently about 30% anxious, 70% depressed."
168,OCD and LSD,Anxiety,"Hey guys, does anyone know how LSD impacts diagnosed OCD? I've tripped like 10 times, all of them were the best times of my life, , but recently I got diagnosed with OCD and I'm under treatment and unsure if it would be safe to comeback to psychedelic in a year or 2, if I can get a bit better (despite there not being a cure). 


I'm afraid of getting psychotic or squizophrenia with the trips because of the OCD since it's a neurotic disease, but there's the question in the medical field if it should turn into psychosis


Will I fry my brain and go into psychosis if I keep take it? I have a deep fear of going mad. Can acid cause that to ocd suffers?"
169,Apologized for removing my friend on Snapchat due to anxiety and got no response back,Anxiety,"Long story short we had been talking a lot and then things slowed down. I had an awkward week and a half mental health wise and so was super anxious and thought maybe she was pumping the breaks on the friendship because we had a conversation about feelings. Neither of us was really that interested in the other but I felt like it could have been misinterpreted because we had this talk over text - turns out she was just super busy, kind of really sad, and turned off by me being anxious and didn’t want to talk as much with someone she wasn’t dating all of which is fine. We talked it through the other day and I thought we were cool.

Think is right before she told me that I decided she was trying to end the friendship and so I removed her on Snapchat twice - I get these urges to cut people off when I think their avoiding me or not interested in being friends and so I did it. Its like a way of cutting myself off from whatever is making me anxious. I deleted text conversations etc too but this was a bigger thing, which I’ve only done once before. Anyways I apologized for it on snap today and she just never responded, so I sent a follow message which was never responded to. Both opened just no response :/

Did I hurt the friendship even more or should I just be patient here? Maybe she’ll respond later?"
170,This one is bad,Anxiety,"The physical symptoms of this panic attack is directly mimicking a heart attack. The sharp stabbing pain in my left chest, the pulsing neck pain, the achy left arm. I've been to the ER so many times and my medicine was helping and then boom, this one pops up out of nowhere. No matter how many times I tell myself it has to be a panic attack my body and mind won't listen. I'm so scared.. I just want to be okay. 😢"

172,Anybody here with a positive birth experience ?,Anxiety,"I'm pregnant , got 3 1/2 months left to go before I give birth and I'm having a panic attack just thinking about it. I have horrible anxiety /panic attacks and I just need some relief."
173,Instant anxiety relief?,Anxiety,"My anxiety gives me a feeling of a knot in my chest that i cant undo. Breathing becomes manual rather than automatic. I get maybe two to three full breaths if im lucky. 
Does anyone have any tips for this? Distracting myself doesnt seem helpful and this has lead me to take excessive naps as its the only time that i dont have to consciously force breathing."
174,.,Anxiety,"I can't stress enough how awful anxiety really is. Today, I had another panic attack, which, sadly, I've been experiencing a lot lately. Heart racing, head spiralling, stomach in knots. Now, I feel like my energy has been completely sucked out of me and my face is hot and my chest is tight and all I want to do is lie down and cry"
175,Struggling with self worth,Anxiety,"I’m putting myself out there with this post because I’m struggling. I’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder for 6 years. I’m very aware of how to manage myself usually. The issue is I feel so fucking empty lately. 

I haven’t been able to find a job because of the pandemic. I worked my ass off to get two bachelors, (one of which is for a foreign language that’s common in my country) and worked abroad twice while doing my undergrad. 

I’ve been holed up at home since all of this got so wild with the exception of driving cross country (all masked and kept to ourselves) to help a friend move. I still got COVID back in August because of my boyfriend’s shitty boss being one of those “it’s a hoax”ers. At the end of the day, it feels like me staying home is all for nothing anyways seeing as everyone is refusing to stay home now and hospitals are at max capacity. No one gives a shit here. 

I just had a bilingual interview where THEY SOUGHT ME OUT for a long term sub position in a school before then telling me “thanks for your time, we’ll keep your info on file but we’re gonna use the in house sub we already had.” I also had bilingual interviews before with big name car companies who promised to get back to me within 48 hours and then ghosted, even with me writing follow up emails. 

This job market is depressing as fuck, has left me in a ridiculous financial rut, and I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel any more. I have had to lean on friends, my S.O., family members, etc. and i feel so worthless for it all. My S.O. repeatedly tells me things are fine but I’ve noticed they seem to be pulling away too. 

Normally I have goals and such keep me looking forward. Now my goal is “find some will to live today  and not feel like a total piece of shit.” I have no self worth left. I don’t feel like I’m worth anything anymore."
176,Weight in your chest in the morning,Anxiety,"Ever wake up and ""feel"" the weight slide down into your chest? I've been experiencing that sensation a lot lately and was wondering if anyone else did, too."
177,Anxiety about Moving Out During COVID,Anxiety,"So I’m 27 and have been living in a city with roommates for the past few years. Back at the start of COVID, I moved home with my family in the suburbs, as it was feeling really hard to stay sane while quarantining with so many roommates in a small house. 
The past 9 months with my family has been great, for the most part. I miss my friends and being in the city, but it’s been really nice to be with family. My family is super close, especially me and my sister and I haven’t lived with them in a while, so it’s been a good experience. 
My mom is a stay at home mom and has been doing the bulk of the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. I’ve been helping out as much as she’ll let me, but I am afraid of becoming complacent now that I don’t have to do those things. 
I never intended to be here for 9 months, so I’ve been looking at one bedrooms and thinking about moving out if I find something good. Then the other week, I found a great apartment in my favorite neighborhood of the city, with cheaper rent due to covid (it would typically be hard for me to live in this area). I was excited and thought I should jump on it. 
Now that I just got approved for the apartment, I am starting to feel freaked out instead of excited. I’m a people person and have never lived alone before (I was initially hoping to get a roommate but that’s not possible as my friends are all living with their partners). 
I’m worried with COVID that I’ll be lonely and regret this decision, as if I keep living at home I’ll have company and will save money. On the other hand, I did pay off my student debt during quarantine, this a great place, and it seems like we’ll have a vaccine soon and things are getting better. Plus, my family will be close by and I have friends in the neighborhood. 
I’m leaning towards moving but keep feeling dread/anxiety when I go to sleep. Has anyone experienced anxiety around moving? What are your thoughts on how to deal with this situation? Thank you!!"
178,i feel like nobody sees how hard it actually is,Anxiety,"i’m so sick of being told “you seem like you’re doing fine to me” when literally everything is a struggle and it’s literally killing me just to “function” and do normal daily activities. i’m constantly faking enjoying things and pretending like i care. all that ever goes through my head is horrible dark intrusive thoughts. i’m literally living in a constant state of impending doom. just because i can make small talk and manage to get to work everyday does not mean i’m magically cured, that just implies that i’m dramatic sometimes. people only believe that i’m struggling when i’m crying or hyperventilating, they don’t realize that i feel even worse 24/7. it hurts so bad when my loved ones just choose to ignore how hard i try to be a normal fucking person. i hope this made sense, thanks for reading"
179,How to help someone who is anxious about going out with you?,Anxiety,"I (25F) just started talking to a new guy (31M) a few weeks ago. He’s really sweet and kind and has commented on how he enjoys talking to me and said he had goosebumps from the number of things we have in common. I really don’t know him well because we haven’t had any dates yet. I had given him an “out” a few times saying if he didn’t feel comfortable because of covid I understood, and specifically said if he didn’t want to hang out to let me know.  He said covid doesn’t do anything for him  and expressed multiple times that he would “love” to get together. 

Every time we try to make plans he never follows through with them. He’ll initiate by saying we should get together, are you available tonight, etc. But then when I say yes and try to make more concrete plans, he ghosts me until the next day. Then I get an apology text with a little more about his story. The first time it happened he told me he wanted me to know that he got out of a relationship that was more than a decade. Another time, he said he sometimes won’t open texts for a while because of anxiety. Then it was that he went to bed early because his sleep schedule was messed up. And most recently it was a detailed message about how he’s in constant depression and anxiety and it’s a challenge to survive. 

I’m trying to be patient but it’s hard getting my hopes up every time he asks “what about tonight?” 

I told him we’ll find a time and place that makes him feel comfortable. I asked if there was anything I could do to help. What else can I do?"
180,Extremely anxious,Anxiety,"Recently my anxiety is reaching extremely high levels. I vomit and rub my neck quite hard when anxious. Currently I’ve been rubbing it so much it’s red raw and constantly hurts. I’m having anxiety attacks in work, home and the street. I’ve always had problems with anxiety but since my dad has been out of the picture I’ve had to support my mum and brother and lay the bills. 
I find it hard to continue having a social life because I’m taking a lot of over time in work. Because of this my anxiety of going back to college next year is just getting worse. I’m having anxiety attacks over previous anxiety attacks. I’m either eating too much or too little loosing weight fast then gaining weight fast. 
I’ve tried to get help but my doctor refuses to see people because of covid. 
I feel like just ending all this anxiety which makes me even more anxious. I’m just constantly spinning and it feels like there’s no way out of it."
181,Fear of losing my father,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, for the past month or so I’ve been faced with the fact that my father is getting older and the thought of losing him is hurting me so deeply. I’m 20 and he’s 58 but the thing is, he has been through hell his entire life and it shows. My father and my dog were all the people I had growing up, I’ve never had friends so I really relied on those two, but ever since my dog passed on in July I’ve been struck with the realization that we are all going to die one day but I’m so afraid of never seeing my father and my family ever again. He’s told me that it’s a waste of time and energy worrying about the inevitable and that I need to cherish the time that I have with him but it’s so hard when I’m constantly consumed with the fear of being lost and alone. I keep having memories of when I was a child and the things we did together but now I look at my pops and see him aging and it makes me want to run and sob. I’m so afraid to fall asleep because I’m scared I’ll wake up and not have my best friend any longer. I have no one else besides my father to talk to and I feel my hope is completely depleted and the little bit of faith that I tried to muster hasn’t done anything, thats why I’m writing this post, I guess I’m hoping for advice or someone to tell me that it’ll be ok and that the end of this long journey we call life I’ll be able to sit down once again and play games or do things with my father. I really want to stop this pain and fear because my father is still here and I don’t want to waste my time crying and mourning what the future will inevitably bring.

Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day reader."
182,Staying up all night because of an event the next day?,Anxiety,"I have a meeting in work I’m anxious about tomorrow. It’s with my manager and it’s on teams, it’s only a check in but it fills me with anxiety because he insists on having the camera on during meetings for everyone. If I request to turn it off it’s awkward if it’s just him and I’m too anxious to even bring it up.

So now I’m up late. I know I’ll feel like shit tomorrow without sleep but I do it anyway."
184,Anyone else gets easily startled by the doorbell ringing or phone?,Anxiety,"Whenever the doorbell rings I get really startled. Even when I expect guests/delivery. Same with the phone. Chat notifications are okay but when it's a phone call it startles me...

Anything I can do?"
185,Bought a bike!,Anxiety,"As a last resort before talking to my doctor about Zoloft or a daily medication, I bought myself a cheap slin-bike and I’m going to download the Peloton app. I get a lot of anxiety when my heart rate goes up, but I remember back when I was “normal”, I took spin classes and they really opened up my lungs and made me feel good all day. Wish me luck!"
186,Lightheaded faint,Anxiety,"I randomly for absolutely no reason feel like I’m going to faint extremely lightheaded and then I rush into extreme anxiety because I obviously get scared, I feel faint everyday for 6 months, is this generalized anxiety after math, I had my first panic attack in April and ever since that day i have been feeling faint every single day, is this even anxiety???? Help"
187,"Anxious whenever I have to talk by voice-chat and the like, anyone else like me? Any tips?",Anxiety," Alright, so, I know I don't have it as bad as some others, but whenever I gotta talk to people in a game, or to co-workers, my anxiety will pop right back up, and more often than not, I'll try to think of an excuse not to (got a headache, got work to do, etc) What's weird, is that in person, I don't have that kind of problem, it's only when talking via voice chat"
188,Things taste funny and my mouth is dry. Has anyone with anxiety experienced this?,Anxiety,Just was wondering. Thank you.
189,Lightheaded/ faint feeling,Anxiety,"Does anyone else get lightheaded and feel like they are going to faint daily from anxiety, the feeling is a mixture of dissociation lightheaded faint feeling which causes me to have anxiety. I don’t have anxiety about something and get lightheaded it’s the other way around. It’s been over 6 months like this so it kind of rules out anything else medical I think. Any advice ? Anyone one else feel this feeling? I can’t drive I’m scared to even go to the store. I feel like my life has been taken from me. I’m not scared of anxiety I’m scared of the feeling of fainting."
190,"New job makes me so anxious that I get sick, but I feel too guilty to quit",Anxiety,"I'm 26 and I live with my parents. I was teaching overseas a year ago and have only taken up small odd jobs since I've been back. I always thought I wanted to teach, so I recently got a job at a school near me. It's my first full-time job in over a year. I thought I'd be passionate about it, but instead I dread going. I cry everyday and can't sleep because of it. I've been working there a month and a half and by now all my thoughts are about quitting.

I just feel too guilty to quit. It's a school job, and they desperately needed someone for the position, so I don't want to leave them without a replacement. Everyone I know has been congratulating me on the job. And, most importantly, my parents are kind enough to let me stay with them, but I have to get out. My mother and I fight constantly. I need money to move. It feels awful, but money is basically ruling my life right now. I've applied to a few online jobs because being home makes me feel much better than being in a school environment (my job is *very* high stress). I also need the job for health benefits.

Is a month too soon to quit a full-time job? Does anyone else feel crushed by the stress everyday before they go to work? Should I just suck it up, since everyone else in the world seems to be able to work under duress? Please, any words of advice would help."
191,It's been 7 days since I lost my appetite,Anxiety,"It happened when I had a panic attack after eating something. Ever since then I haven't had an appetite. The first few days I barely ate which made me feel sick, so ever since then I've been forcing myself to eat. But even though I feel some kind of hunger pangs it doesn't feel like being hungry, or craving food. And when I do force myself to eat it's so difficult that I have to eat very slowly. Basically I'll have a few bites, wait 10 minutes then have a few more. Usually I finish a bowl of pasta in an hour or even more.

Also for the past two days I've been having weird chills, but no fever. These things together make me worried I'm sick, or have the dreaded virus (even tho I don't have any actual symptoms of that).

I just don't know what to do with myself anymore, do I push to see a doctor? Is it worth it considering how difficult and even risky that is these days? Buy what if I'm ignoring something real because I have no choice but to attribute any symptom to anxiety?"
192,Progress is progress,Anxiety,"My lexapro is doing wonders. Now if only I could get the rest of my body to feel normal enough to keep up with the daily activities. I've been pushing myself to get stuff done around the house and put up christmas lights but just as much, I am making sure to lay down or sit when I need to and being kind to myself when I need a moment to re collect myself. 

This time of year can be so challenging for people with anxiety and I just gotta say keep challenging yourself and be kind! Any small task being done or attempted is progress and worth doing."
193,do not stop believing in yourself.,Anxiety,"3 years ago i moved to a different country. I didnt know the language and i already had a lot of social anxiety problems before so basically i was fucked. i wasnt able to talk to anyone i felt like im just a piece of shit i was failing all my classes i didnt have any friends i basically felt like a complete failure and the only thing i felt when i tried to meet new people was anxiety. Now 3 years later after accepting my mental problems and facing them , im able to talk to people in their language even if im still speaking wrong from time to time but its just normal u cant learn anything new without failing. Please accept the fact you are going to fail. but thats just the only way of getting rid of this fucking shitty anxiety. be a fucking fighter and face ur fear. There is no other way out. i believe in all of you you can do it guys pls dont give up"
194,new food anxiety,Anxiety,"i’ve always had pretty bad health anxiety where i become hyper aware of physical sensations or symptoms. i recently had a lot of family drama and haven’t been doing too well, so lots of stress. was on lexapro 10mg for two months, tried buspar 5mg for a few weeks instead which worked HORRIBLY and now am getting back on lexapro. for about a week now i’ve had this huge anxiety over a choking feeling constantly in my throat. i went to the ER for it and they came back with normal CAT scans and x-rays. i’m scheduled for a thyroid ultrasound because it’s a little underactive and i have no clue if it can be another issue. doctor is suggesting a GI in case. 

my question is, what the hell brought on this anxiety and how do i get rid of it? i’m already really thin and thinner due to the stress and now i trigger automatic anxiety when i have to eat that i barely eat a thing. :-("
195,Irrational Thoughts at Mach Speed,Anxiety,"Hello r/Anxiety,

I've been battling some reflux lately and I've had a few people recommend I look into ""my anxiety"" as a cause. This was news to me being that I wasn't aware I had anxiety! While I know this isn't a place for a diagnosis and I do plan to speak to a mental health professional this week, I wanted to share a short incident that today lead my wife, who used to work in the mental health field, to say, ""THAT is anxiety.""

We were working in the backyard while our 3 kids played inside. I heard a car door shut and my first thought...like an instant / didn't-have-a-chance-to-catch-it thought...was that someone parked out front and would come in and take our children.

Now I've never been in a kidnapping situation. We live in a quiet, very safe neighborhood on a cul de sac. This thought is completely irrational and not something I would consciously think. My question to the group here is - can anxiety present in sort of a subconscious way? 

I'm normally very high strung. I get angry quickly. Can never make decisions. Don't sleep well and often find my shoulder pulled up near my ears and have this crawling sensation on my face. This has become more prevalent during COVID. But I feel FINE. It's like another part of me has anxiety but I feel normal. 

I discussed with my PCP and he mentioned Lexapro but said I should talk to a therapist first. I'm fully committed to understanding the concept of anxiety but want to make sure I don't end up down a Dr Google rabbit hole of despair. 

Again, wanted to introduce myself, ask about this ""automatic thinking"" and say I look forward to the support and camaraderie this sub has to offer as I journey to figure this puzzle out. I've started some breathing exercises and mediation but I know those have their limitations."
196,Anxiety with rituals?,Anxiety,"Firstly, I don’t have diagnosed OCD, but just GAD. Yet, I have always carried out minor rituals (like small superstitions) that I irrationally thought would protect me from things I cannot control. Anyone else have some rituals but have not been diagnosed with OCD?"
197,I have an exam in about 48 hours that I’m entirely not prepared for but my anxiety is preventing me from doing anything about it,Anxiety,As per the title. Am genuinely afraid of failing my final. It’s my 3rd day in a row with barely any sleep because everytime I doze off for a minute my anxiety wakes me right back up. It’s killing my productivity. My brain is so sleep deprived that it barely lets me even look at my content for more than a couple minutes at a time even though I’m only 1/3 of the way through the syllabus. I constantly feel like fainting. Any tips?
198,anyone else do this?,Anxiety,whenever i go into a public toilet stall i always look up because im anxious someone is looking over at me. Probably just me being paranoid
199,My own name jump scared me.,Anxiety,"I had a major break down today; a nasty combination of depression, insomnia, PTSD triggers, urge to self harm and finally a “I am defective” trigger. I made a mistake at work...it’s been an exhausting week. Unfortunately when I make one mistake everyone is going to take a picture, send it to an endless chain of managers and I am going to be threatened with discipline and degraded as a human being all day. And likely the rest of the week. I realize this is a horribly toxic work place; but I just don’t have any other option that pays the bills.  Lately I have been so on edge that just hearing my name causes me panic, heart racing and dizziness, and overall fear. Eventually I realized my name is only spoken when I am about to be criticized, and degraded. I live on my own, so I have no loved ones to provide some positive reinforcement. 

I took a short break at work, hidden in the furtherest corner of the room hoping to be unnoticed while I tried cram weeks of stress into a 30 minute meltdown before going back to face more humiliation. Then, I heard my name unexpectedly; and I just jumped up and screamed. Screamed and jerked the way  people expect you to during a jump scare. It was shriek of pure terror. I thought it was my manager coming to pull me from break and berate me some more. It wasn’t. It was just a passing, friendly coworker who was saying goodbye.

And now, on top of everything else I have shame because I had such a knee jerk reaction. I didn’t know what to say other than I am sorry and admitted I was going through some intense stressors. 

Just...needed to vent. I cannot unwind from the day I had. I truly wish I had better career hope, but for the foreseeable future I just don’t have much choice."
200,I don't recognise myself in the mirror,Anxiety,"Hey everyone! Let's get straight to the point - for the past year or so I've been heavily burdened because of personal stuff I don't want to get into right now. Crying has been a regular activity for the past 3 or so months. Everything feels too much for me to handle. I had been refraining from putting a label on it myself, especially because a therapist is currently not an option for me, but I think I get anxiety episodes every now and then.

Today, after a similar episode, I looked at myself in the mirror and - I don't know how to describe it - I didn't recognise myself at all. I got the same feeling you get when you're walking on the sidewalk and see some random guy going past. The face of my chemistry professor who's only been teaching me for about 6 months (that was the only face I had for comparison at the moment) bore more recognition to me. I was already scared and after this even more so.

Is this something that any of y'all have experienced? Should I consider going to a therapist about it or will it be alright?

Thanks!"
201,I'M HAVING TO PASS OUT ALMOST AND HAVING THE INTENSE PANIC ATTACK AND I'M NAUSEOUS,Anxiety,I'm 13 and day by day I start getting worse symptoms I just had 4 taco bell tacos and may be having a heart attack
202,Anyone has trouble shutting down their mind and sleep whenever you have something important coming up the next day?,Anxiety,"Left my new job only after a day due to this issue. Tried to fix my sleep schedule for 2 weeks but failed. Got 2 hours of sleep before the first day of new job, only got an hour the night after. Couldn’t think clearly as my mind kept racing and I was constantly thinking ‘will I be able to finally shut down my mind and sleep tonight or is it going to be another sleepless night and go to the office the next morning looking like shit and unable to function normally’

Came the second day, feeling terribly anxious about many things coupled with fatigue, I resigned. Lucky thing is I still could drive from home to office or else I’d have ended up in an accident. After resigning, I finally got my sleep that night. F my life. Now I feel like an idiot for leaving the job because I like the company. Feeling like applying for a job there again, maybe for another position, but I know I’ll end up looking more stupid and unprofessional in the hiring manager’s eyes. And what if the planets aligned, should they miraculously entertain my application, the sleep trouble occur yet again? 

I’m stuck and tired of feeling this way"
203,"Someone set a car on fire outside my place tonight, a couple weeks ago there was a shooting,",Anxiety,How on earth do you deal with this shit? My anxiety is though the roof right now...
204,Vaping/Smoking setting off anxiety,Anxiety,"Gone through some life changes (new work team, moving in with friends, seeing someone new) and was fine for the first month before going into the worst set of panic attacks I’ve ever had. On Zoloft and therapy now which I find is helping but still a way off from being back to myself 24/7. 

One thing I noticed was a tight chest ruining my sleeping habits, and then I noticed that I had started back vaping a few weeks before my anxiety hit a peak. 

Stopped vaping altogether earlier this week and started getting some real testing anxiety moments again.

Could I really have gotten this addicted to nicotine in the space of a month to the point where it put me on full anxiety mode?  I do wildly overuse the vape when I have it, and most of my worst moments are when I’m out somewhere and not using it. 

I have always smoked the odd cigarette but no doubt am massively increasing my nicotine intake by smoking a vape all day."
205,Is it normal for my mother to treat me this way?,Anxiety,"My mother knows about my anxiety and how bad it gets. Every time I literally can't do something, like it's impossible for me to do, and I tell her, she either forces me into the situation or tells me she's disappointed in me(usually sighs, says my name and looks at me sternly). I don't know if that's supposed to help with my anxiety cause it usually just causes it to get worse and makes me feel like i'm gonna black out"
206,Somebody made a post similar to this but I really just wanted to vent. Anxiety makes you look like a bad person.,Anxiety,"One example was about a week my mum/mom got mad at me for not speaking to someone who was one of my younger brothers friends older sister who was about the same age as me.  
I told her about how i could speak to people and all she said was 'It makes you seem very rude'  and did not even care about the fact that I basically admitted to having social anxiety... and then she blamed it on my laptop saying I spend to much time on it.  


I just wish people understood me. I wish I had people that were here for me all the time."
207,"Feeling very very overwhelmed today, my anxiety makes it so difficult to get out of bed every day and it’s exhausting pretending to everyone around me that I’m fine. I’m desperately trying but nothing seems to work 😪",Anxiety,Edit - thank you everyone who commented xx

209,How do I get anxiety medication with the first day of therapy/ doctors appointment,Anxiety,"I have a doctors appointment/ therapy is on Monday (Tomorrow) and I want medication on the first day, but I think they want me to try the exercises without medication. How do I convince my doctor that I want medication with the exercises on the first day?"
210,Temple/behind ear twitching,Anxiety,"So for about 6+ months now I’ve have this twitching on my left temple/ear area no pain or discomfort or anything, at first I didn’t think anything of it at first but now since it’s been so long I’m starting to get more worried and my anxiety doesn’t help and makes me thing of the worst like if there’s something else going on in my head. I’ve noticed it’s it’s progressed to my right side temple/ear area and idk what to do at this point. I’ve seen allot saying it’s just stress or anxiety but I’m not convinced. I don’t have money nor insurance to go get it checked it out so I’m hoping to get some answers here to calm my nerves a bit."
211,Starting to think that my anxiety stems from selfishness,Anxiety,"My family isn't taking covid seriously. I think laughing is their way of coping. But I realized that their selfishness, lack of consideration for others, triggers my anxiety/attacks. I know I have no control over their selfishness, but it still bugs the shit out of me. Maybe it's the ADHD?... Anyways, does anyone else notice that their anxiety gets triggered by others selfishness?

Edit: I then thought, ""what does selfishness root from?"" and I think the answer to that is control. So anxiety roots from some form of control that we feel/think we lack, perhaps? Maybe have too much of? Hm..."
212,"Cancer 'cured' my anxiety, healing made it worse",Anxiety,"I always used to be anxious since I was a child. 
I was diagnosed cancer at 17 and got a 9-months treatment for it.
My anxiety disappeared, I always felt confident, social, I felt no pressure, no panic attacks, no overwhelming fear. I thought it was strange to feel this good mentally while I was suffering physically.
But the healing process brought me back to reality, my anxiety got worse and worse. The more my body was gaining strength and energy, the more my mental health deteriorated. 
At some point I even hoped for my cancer to return.

Is there any explanation for this thing it's happening? Why was healing so bad for me?

Note: excuse me for my grammar, English is not my native language."
213,Severe anxiety and neck/face tension,Anxiety,"For the past 6 weeks ive been suffering with tension running down the side of my face/neck, my trap and my deltoid into my tricep. Everything's cleared up except for the neck and face tension which will come and go in strength but always is there until i lie down in bed or sit at the pc with proper posture. Its not severe i haven't had any real pain for like 3 weeks but for the beginning 2 weeks i convinced myself of anything from cervical radiculopathy to bone growths in spine to spine misalignment to myofascial pain syndrome to thoracic outlet. (I visited a gp and a spine orthopedist and both said my neck rotation is fine, gp told me he thought it was cervical radiculopathy but on a followup sent me to pt saying possibly muscle strain)

I did have a weird flare up where on week 2 i panicked so hard my entire arm tensed up soooo tight and the veins popped to the surface and the tension went all the way from my right face to my palm of the right hand, i was so spaced out and i was talking very slow and monotone just saying i didnt want to live in this hell. (after a walk it completley went away, since i had veins popping in both hands the gp and pt chalked it up to anxiety since there was no purple or tingling in the hand and my heartrate was through the roof)

I have a pt whos helped mobilize my body and thats helped alot but so far the last thing to go is the tension starting behind my jaw under my ear down to the pit of my clavicle or i guess my scalenes, the tension shifts from the clavicle to my jaw and cheek to behind my head and it drives me up a wall with fear that it will be here forever, i dry heave when i start really panicking. Im on lorazepam and celexa and they help a bit but im so scared this minor pulling in my neck and jaw will never go away and im looking everywhere for help but also just need to vent because nothing has happened to me in my life like this and its terrible for my already obsessive anxiety."
214,Anxiety and Dating,Anxiety,"Anyone else have issues with dating? I tend to find myself liking someone and really really wanting a relationship and then as soon as they feel the same, I feel physically ill. Like the idea of actually dating makes me sick. If I want a relationship, why am I repulsed by one?"
215,School- how to man up and suck it up?,Anxiety,"Already posted this on r/advice and did not get really good advice

I am sick and tired of going there everyday. It's the same thing over and over again. I don't have any friends, and can't make any, For some reason everyone is against me. I've been thinking about dropping out and not continuing school next year, but my parents want me to continue, so how do I man up and suck it up?

I get really bad anxiety and also have trust issues because all of my friends backstabbed me a year ago.

I would drop out but my whole family would be mad at me and they are the only people I can talk with and be ""friends"" with."
216,"BFS twitching, fasciculations and ALS anxiety.",Anxiety,"Hi, I’m 24 yo male and I have widespread twitching/fasciculations for more that a year already. I guess I had this phenomenon even earlier but I didn’t pay too much attention to it. But then I got informed about such a diagnosis as ALS and since then it’s my Number 1 phobia. I still feel twitching, I still have perceived weakness in some parts of my body and I’m to terrified to do tests such as EMG. 
A few neurologies told me that I’m fine but I still feel uncomfortable and unable to live my best life always thinking of this three letters. So guys does anyone else have this problem and how long do you struggle. Every comment will be helpful. Much love"

218,Anybody taking zoloft and drink alcohol occasionally?,Anxiety,"So I take zoloft 200mg. Have for about 10 years now (lower dose when i was a kid). Anyways, I also recently turned 21, and i occasionally drink.

I normally have 1-3 drinks a day on the weekend and a glass of wine at night 1-2 nights a week. I'm not an alcoholic, rarely actually gotten drunk (I'd say less than 5 times). I know, I know- I'm going to cut back. Really am. Just sorta wormed its way into my daily life.

But today after having 2 drinks in 2 hours in started shaking pretty bad and having some ocd/anxiety. Wondering if the two are correlated? Anybody out there take zoloft and drink?"

220,Autophobia achievement,Anxiety,"I have a great fear of being alone, so much so that I slept with my mother until 13.

Over the past year, I spent a lot of my time working on being alone with myself.

Going from having a mental breakdown when noone's in the room with me, all the way to being alone and 'confident' for a whole day is a huge feat for me.

225,My job makes me feel anxious and depressed,Anxiety,"This is my first job I got it when I was 19 years old after finishing highschool. I never thought that I will have a job because I have social anxiety but they hired me right after the interview. It's a big store that mostly sells clothes makeup and home decour stuff.
First it was very busy but I started enjoying it meet some really good people there.
But my managers wasn't the nicest one of them hate me for no reason and always put me in the cash register after I said that I don't like it. I got almost no training so I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning which destroyed my confidence and made me very anxious.
Recently the good people left the company and the boss of the store is very toxic shouting at us if he's angry... I've been there for 1 and half year and feel like I can't do it anymore. This place made my anxiety so bad that sometimes I have panic attacks before work. I want to quit but I'm afraid what comes after what if I don't find another job ever again what if other jobs are worst than this...
My mom is supportive about it saying if I don't feel good there I should quit but I don't want to be home doing nothing... I want to go to university next year but it's very far...
I hate myself because I can't handle this and I'm scared about the future every day...
Don't know what to do need some advice 😔"
226,Question involving xanax,Anxiety,"Hi guys, ive been struggling with anxiety for 3 months now and since then i have been taking xanax situationally only going up to about .75mg. well since earlier this month, i had started to take .50mg every night to sleep and during the day if i did need it i would take .25mg.this has been a thing now for about 4 weeks. recently i decided to try and tapper off my night time dose and only take .25 mg at night and if i need it .25mg during the day. My question is (and i hope this doesn't sound stupid) how likely is it for me to experience bad withdrawal symptoms? Im really scared of having a seizure or something bad happening to me. I dont see people ever say they have problems coming off of it when the dose is at that lowest point it always people who take like 2mg or more. It might just me being anxious but i just wanted to know your guys thoughts."

Hopefully I do this correctly. 

As stated in the title, I’m looking for insight on how to not spend so much of my time and energy feeling so angry at my [many] friends and family members who’ve continued to eat out/travel/get together, etc. during the pandemic. Just a little info on me (if it helps), I have generalized anxiety as well as depression. I do take medication for these and am not currently in talk therapy, but I am looking for low-cost options for the new year. I’m an empath and someone who has always felt very deeply for the entire human race (aside from trump and his cronies, obvi). Controlling my negative emotions has always been a struggle for me and this year has really done a number on me. Any helpful input is appreciated. Thanks y’all. I hope you all have a healthy and pleasant holiday season."

231,Feeling anxious. Would like some guidance and help please.,Anxiety,"I'm feeling anxious, I guess it's a 5/6 on a level of 10 with 10 being the highest. I'm anxious about going back to work tomorrow, i.e Monday and having to work. This week was Thanksgiving so I took a day off before, stopped working at 3PM on Tuesday and took Wednesday off and today is Sunday, gotta go back to work tomorrow on Monday. I don't know why I feel like this, I do like my job, but the thought of having such a small break, and going back to work the next day and the next day and the day after that, till the day I die is very anxiety causing. I'm not sure of what to do. Any advice please?"
232,Every year,Anxiety,"I go through this cycle of wanting to be alone. I don’t want to be bothered, but here we go, it’s the holidays. I have to act like I’m thankful for living with homophobes, and act like I’m okay because I’m forced to go to church where they’re against lgbt people. I also had “friends” there who told me that prayer can heal my anxiety.. like bitch, I’ve been trying for years!

Yes I’m fucking pissed off today, but it’s just because I want to be alone, but no, I have to do shit with family (not church, thanks Covid) and now I have to hear how If I sit in my room, I will have more depression and anxiety while they simultaneously complain I have a chip on my ducking shoulders.

234,Social anxiety and communication,Anxiety,"Ever since I have entered the workforce I have noticed a few problems with my brain and thought process.

I have recognised that I have a poor ability to group my thoughts properly, and communicate clearly. 

I can’t express my ideas clearly. When at work people around me will be talking, expressing ideas, but me, I’ll be silent. I just can’t communicate. I get nervous and stop thinking.

It takes me a long time to process information and hold a proper intellectual conversation with someone. I really really want to change this but I don’t know where to begin.

How can I communicate and express my ideas clearly without getting anxious and nervous?

How can I process information faster?"
235,"Cooking smells, even “good” smells cause me extreme anxiety and make me want to shower.",Anxiety,"This is kind of a rant because i’m currently really fucking angry at the smell of my family cooking
maybe tw? idk

oh my god if i could remove my sense of smell i would.
I hate smells. They’re fucking obnoxious. In order to be happy i need everything entirely clean and aired out. The smell of food makes me gag.
It causes me genuine anger. Why can’t people fucking air their houses out.
Why does my family cook at weird random times? And why so much cooking?!?!?!
I cook once a day and immediately clean up n light a candle.
The smells stick to my clothes.
I close my door to my bedroom to escape the rotten smells and they seap through n stick to my blankets and my hair and i feel so horrible and dirty 
i just want to cry 
i try opening my window but it won’t to anything
air freshener does nothing
i just feel so filthy and unclean
it makes me want to scrub my skin off 
Why can’t people just be fucking normal and not cook SO MUCH
Just fucking air your house out if you’re going to cook so much fucking food constantly 
It’s always the worst smelling shit too
like ONION
Who the fuck is cooking onion this late? For what fucking purpose?
We have had dinner already?!
Is it necessary?
Am i the only person who gets fucking enraged by smells?"
236,Not sure what to do anymore,Anxiety,"Hey everyone,
I’m fairly new to Reddit so forgive me if I format anything incorrectly. So the last few weeks I’ve been getting really nauseous and have been feeling absolutely horrible. One day I will feel totally fine then the next it just hits me with this awful nausea. I’ve always had anxiety my whole life as my dad has it much worse than me and a few other family members have it as well. Usually it’s been good and under control but the last few months it’s become way worse. 

My sleep schedule has always been not too great either so I’m thinking that may be a big contributing factor. Honestly it just makes me feel so weak and embarrassed about it ya know? It’s like this constant worry and stress that never goes away. The anxiety also tends to turn into depression as well and it makes me have darker thoughts like killing myself just so it will all go away. I feel like I can’t even do the things I enjoy anymore because of this anxious sickness I’ve been experiencing. 

It’s been messing up my digestion and just throwing my whole body out of wack. My girlfriend has been very supportive and says that when I get distracted it tends to go away. Which makes me feel better as hopefully that could mean my anxiety isn’t as bad. I just don’t know what to do anymore guys. Like I just feel so sick and I’ve always been pretty healthy my family doesn’t really have any bad health attributes. Lately I’ve just been more depressed each day because I just can’t imagine living my life feeling like this."
237,Getting Mixed Signals as to Whether Someone Wants to Be My Friend. My Anxiety Can’t Handle it Anymore.,Anxiety,"So me (M20) and this girl (F18) met up and hung out as friends around late September. It was fun and she texted back after saying she had a good time. I asked her to hangout a few more times during October and she was busy. I was getting the vibe that maybe she didn't wanna be my friend or was truly busy. I tend to overthink things so idk.

Last week she texted me for plans which surprised me. She said ""hey! do you ever wanna go to barnes and nobles and look for manga sometime? I’ve actually never been in that section before and I’ve always wanted to look around"" Its something we talked about so ik the text was meant for me. I responded saying ""Yah for sure! Im busy Saturday but totally free Sunday."" I never get a response so Sunday I text her again saying ""Hey! Are you free anytime this week? lmk."" No response. Yesterday she posts a snapchat of her at the store so I guess she ended up going without me.

Its been a week and she hasn't texted. I seriously don't know what I should say to her now. I hate being the clingy person that texts three times in a row. I think she wants to be friends since she's the one that texted me for plans but kinda confused why she went without me and never responded. Definitely not annoyed by me since she texts me for convo sometimes.

One of my girl friends from back home said maybe she thinks I'm pursuing her romantically and that she's shy to meet-up again or doesn't wanna let me down. I definitely get vibes that she's shy or introverted because she talked about how her only friends are online. If thats the case how do I tell her I just wanna hang as friends without being a jerk? I wouldn't be opposed to dating in the future but for now I really just want at least one friend I can hit up for plans at my University. Ive never been more confused by a someone in my entire life. I would really love some solid advice, thanks!"
238,Nighttime Anxiety,Anxiety,"Cursory sorry about formatting I’m on mobile. 
Does anyone have severely intrusive and paranoid thoughts only at night? I get so scared of my typical triggers but magnified x10, like I get so scared a nuclear bomb is going to go off (makes no sense? I live in the Midwest in US lol) or there’s going to be an intruder, or what if ghosts are real, what if something like the boogeyman is gonna get me (I’ve read too many scary stories in my life lol) or whatever the hell else. I feel so insane at night because I’m always so on edge and buy into the paranoia because it feels so real. I’m def gonna bring this up with my therapist when I see her next, but in the meantime, does this affect anyone else in the same way? (Some other notes- I’m not typically paranoid like that during the day and I find myself staying awake till the sun rises and then I’m able to finally sleep because I feel safe) 
Thanks ❤️"
239,Heart hammering but normal pulse?,Anxiety,"Hi y'all, has anyone else experienced this issue where when you're anxious or had an anxiety attack you can feel your heart loudly, your pulse beating throughout your body, but when you take your pulse it's in your normal range? I'd suspect high blood pressure but doctor told me mine is fine.

Normally when I read about anxiety attacks they say ""your heart speeds up, take deep slow breaths to slow it down"" but it's not sped up per se so it's a bit difficult to figure out how to stop the loud pounding after I've done slow breathing."
241,New Facebook Support Group,Anxiety,"Hey! How are you? My name Brianna Fernandez, and I recently started producing a film about anxiety awareness. This is my very first time producing a film, but I have a great team behind me who are also passionate about this topic. The film is called Good Girls, and it's an educational short film that will be used to help educate about mental awareness &amp; anxiety disorders, inspire individuals experiencing symptoms to seek help, and to share about the process one might take and treatment options for alleviating the struggles of anxiety.

Currently, we have our crew, locations, and we are casting, but our major goal is to build a community around the film. We were wondering if you would be interested in joining our facebook group which is used to support each other and provide resources.  

I attached a link to our production company which also connects you to our facebook page :).

243,Dog caught ticks- major anxiety from the thought of these pests,Anxiety,"Recently my family visited my brother's home with our dog and unfortunately came across ticks. My dog wears a small shirt and we saw one (a nymph) crawling on her shirt. We took it off and checked her but didn't find anything. I am someone with very extreme anxiety about ticks. I have bad anxiety in general but ticks are something that scare me so bad. 

Fast forward to last night when I was in my brother's home and found another nymph crawling along my blanket. Immediately I was freaking out. I felt like they were just all over me at that point. We left early to come home from our trip because of it and I got a shower immediately. I checked my body for anything and didn't find anything, but am still worried about something being in my hair. 

We bathed our dog and unfortunately found two ticks on her. Another nymph and one that sort of looked like it had been feeding for a bit, both at the same entrypoint. I stepped up and was the one to remove them, but have been feeling sick and lightheaded since this whole thing started and it's taken a lot out of me to calm myself down to the point where I don't faint. I've felt like I was on the verge of it for a couple times now.

Here is where I need the advice. I am freaking out thinking they're on me now. On our things. On my dog even more than what we found. Are they going to fall off and attach on us in the home?  Are they going to lay eggs inside our house and cause an infestation? Can they crawl from my dog and go on us instead??

These questions have been running through my mind all night long. It may seem like such an overreaction but they are something that have really scared me for most of my life. I havent been able to get any sleep and I'm scratching my body so much that I've begun to practically give myself marks from how hard I'm just panicing and itching THINKING that somethings on me. I also had lice as a kid and that's traumatized me to these small pests that I'm just freaking out.

I've cross posted this on thr r/DogAdvice subreddit to get more help for my dog on her side, but here I think I need more help for myself. I haven't been able to calm myself down since this happened and know ticks aren't a big deal to hunters and more woodsy people, but I haven't really had much experience with this and already have a massive phobia about bugs. Every black speck, every hair brushing against me, every little think I used when I was visiting my brothers house I'm having trouble using again thinking there's something on there. I need some kind of help because I cannot live like this

Tl;dr: dog caught ticks, major anxiety causing panic, how to help calm my mind about these pests"
244,Broken confidence,Anxiety,"I used to be very confident when I was a kid, then I started to stammer(which started when I felt sorry for another kid who stammered in my class). Stammering completely broke my confidence and 10 years later I'm struggling with anxiety, depression, and lack of confidence. I'm Trying very hard to regain atleast a little bit of confidence back."
245,Had 3 final exams today and I did great,Anxiety,I have school anxiety but managed to go to the last day and do the exams. Feeling kind of proud.
246,Ongoing health scare paralysing all other aspects of my life,Anxiety,"I'll skip the details of the physical health problems, but essentially I'm having recurring allergic reactions to a ~mystery substance~. I don't know what it is, my doctors don't know. I've got a literal fucking spreadsheet where I track the ingredients of everything I eat, etc. etc.

Anyway, I had another episode on Saturday and the stress of dealing with it (even though there's nothing I can do) has meant that absolutely nothing has happened all weekend. I've just been in bed, essentially for 48 hours, taking pictures of the reaction to send to my doctor and stressing myself to hell and back thinking about what could be causing it and if I'm going to have another episode (antihistamines have not been helpful and the reaction seems to be getting progressively worse).

I just don't know what to do. I'm doing everything I can on the allergy front, but the anxiety front is making sure that literally nothing else gets done. I have a degree to do and a (COVID-safe) life to live. I'd just love any suggestions you guys have on chilling out enough to be functional right now."
247,anyone else get really paranoid about their reputation?,Anxiety,"These last few months I've become completely consumed by the idea of my reputation. 

I google myself often, frantically deleting everything I can and becoming hysterical about the things I can't. When my friends were being loud and having fun several nights ago, all I could think about was if other people could hear us and what they would think. I don't share my opinions online or in conversation anymore, and every time I try to post even the most boring shit on social media I end up quickly deleting it. I'm terrified of any friend I'm publicly associated with sharing a controversial opinion, and becoming tangentially connected with it. 

I have nightmares about being dogpiled with hatred online, or employers not hiring me because of an internet post, or someone not wanting to be my friend because of something they heard out of context.

It's really starting to interfere with my daily function, and the worst part is I don't really even have any hot takes in the first place. I've never done anything really bad to my knowledge- I just can't stop feeling paranoid."
248,Me and my friend got into a fight and they told me to kill myself,Anxiety,"This was online so it was not as bad as if it were to happen in person...  
I blocked them and I don't even know what to do anymore. I really don't care if they meant it or not they crossed the line."
249,How to calm the mind,Anxiety,"Hi guys!

I’ve been using journaling for the past 7-8 months to calm my anxiety. I find that when my mind is just exploding with racing thoughts and I’m not able to calm down with my normal wind-down routine (breathing, no phone etc.) - journaling is that one thing that makes my mind shut up and I’m able to relax again.

It took me a few months to get the hang of it. When I was starting out, journaling felt so overwhelming because I didnt know What to journal or how to approach it. So I bought some journals that had the same questions every day that focuses on gratitude. It definitely made me more grateful, but that wasnt really my goal. And I got bored of answering the same questions every single day.

The best way to approach it turned out to be just journaling whatever was on my mind, and when I was struggling to find my thoughts, I would use a prompt from the internet like: «I feel the most calm when I...»
That really helped. 
Recipe = whatever on my mind/be inspired by a prompt. 

So for christmas presents this year, I want to gift my loved ones peace of mind. I am planning on making all my friends and family a journal that is like this:

- An introduction to journaling, and why it is effective at calming the mind, the science behind it, and famous people that journal (motivating them to try it out)

- 90 Pages for 90 days of journaling (including Different writing prompts for each day if your struggling with writing) 

- The prompts are all aimed towards calming the mind

Is there anything you would add to make the journal more effective at calming the mind?"
250,Does anyone else get anxiety everyday about their health because of one condition?,Anxiety,"For example, I have GERD but for some reason, every day I fear that it may be esophageal cancer or something and anxiety gives me brutal physical symptoms"
251,HIV Fear....,Anxiety,"Hello everyone,

47 days ago on a weekend I had casual penetrative vaginal sex with two women at different times. I used condoms both times and when I finished we made sure that it was in good condition, it didn’t break or something like that, but i didn’t fill it with water to make sure, i never do.

 I made oral sex to one of them and I fingered both of them, I bite my nails maybe this put me in risk, but doctors told me is very very low risk.

But 17 days after those encounters I felt feverish (99.4 F Armpit Temperature), i had fatigue (I stayed in bed for a few hours), i had a headache (strong) and muscle pain, but these symptoms lasted 1 day and a half, maybe two days max. Now i feel good and i don’t have any symptoms! Yesterday I noticed a little bump on my armpit, maybe it a swollen node i don’t know. Oh! It was not COVID what happened because I tested negative.

&amp;#x200B;

I called an HIV/STD organization in my city and I explained my case to them and they told me to be calm, that there is nothing to worry about! But I don’t usually get sick so I don’t know.

&amp;#x200B;

NEXT Tuesday on *December 1* (**World AIDS/HIV Day**, what a coincidence, right?), I have an appointment for a HIV *4th Generation* Exam at the hospital in city in Madrid (Europe). I waited this long so I have a good window period. I will receive the results after 5-6 days, so i will have to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I am afraid but I have to be strong, the wisest thing is to take the exam. I can't sleep well at night, I regret my actions. I know there is no cure but with the new advances in medicine it is possible to live a decent and healthy life. Getting tested is the greatest act of self-love that i can do to myself. I know I will be fine, public health care is good in Spain and I know that my family will never abandon me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading!"
271,I'm gonna get tested tomorrow and I don't know how to get through it,Anxiety,"Someone at the office tested positive, and now all of my colleagues including me needs to get tested tomorrow.

I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so the thought of hearing other people gagging and getting my throat swabbed really sets off my anxiety. 

I'm sitting here the day before the test and is mildly freaking out about it. I've been tested once before, and the medical worker could barely get a sample from me, and back then I went with my boyfriend which made the situation slightly better. Tomorrow I'll have to go alone, and I don't know how to get through it."
272,Is social media becoming to toxic for you?,Anxiety,It's getting that way for me. I used to get badly drawn in by it all frequently but I'm trying to change that. Why can't people just be a bit more friendly about everything. I honestly believe that social media has increased my anxiety in ways that I can't describe.
273,"Internet friend thinks I’m about same age as them, don’t want to make them feel weird bc I’m younger",Anxiety,"So basically I met this person on a writing subreddit when I offered to edit their story for her and even after they took a break from writing, we still talk about books and such and I really enjoy texting them. But I’m actually only 14-15 and they’re in university, and I think they assumed that I was 17-18 when I said I was in high school. They even recently asked me if college apps were going well. I don’t want to freak them out or make them feel uncomfortable because I’m younger than them, but I also don’t really want to lie because I know it’s going to bit me in the ass later."
274,Just started taking Sertraline and it's making me feel super weird.,Anxiety,"I've been taking sertraline for my anxiety for a few days now, I'm only on 25mg, my doctor told me that I might experience headaches and nausea and that the positive effects wouldn't take effect until at least two weeks. Well I'm about 4 days in now and I've had a bit of nausea but nothing extreme. 

What's really bothering me is that it's making me feel super anxious, paranoid, and high. I hate how I feel on this drug and I'm wondering if this is normal? I'm considering dumping the rest of the pills and forgetting about trying medication. Sorry if this has been asked before, I'm currently on sertraline and I feel like I'm living in a dream."
275,Overthinking the slightest coordinative tasks.. anyone else?,Anxiety,"So this is basically my everyday life. I overthink the simplest coordinative tasks and look stupid doing so, because I am afraid of looking stupid in the first place and my body is stiff as hell.

My mind simply doesn't function properly. Let's say there are two objects very near to each other on a desk (one armlength separated from each other). Instead of taking the first object and then reaching for the second without moving, I first reach to the first and then \*walk\* to the second and take it.

My mind is basically very inefficient at doing the simplest tasks because it doesn't know how to, because it is not on ""automatic"" mode but rather on ""manual"" mode. It's like telling yourself to be conscious about your breath and all of a sudden having a hard time breathing because it feels so forced.

What can I do to not look stupid? This applies to pretty much everything I do and it's the absolute worst whenever I eat with other people. My mind simply unlearns to eat and I don't know what to do with my fork. This is super embarassing to tell but I even have such pressure that instead of rolling noodles onto my fork I shove them on the fork as if they were something else. It's like I simply don't know what the fuck to do.

This is very intense when I feel observed but it also happens when I observe myself. I'm even afraid of disappointing myself and not being normal, so I somehow internalize that I am indeed not normal and do the weirdest stuff.

I simply don't know what to do. Does anybody else have a similar problem? It's been persisting since more than a decade and at some point I simply don't want to live like that anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

\* This insecurity is by the way the root cause of all my problems. My relationships suffered a lot from it because I don't feel confident in even cooking or doing stupid stuff. I always look stupid doing so or am overwhelmed by the tasks. Opening a can, during work (laboratory work is very coordinative and I tend to shake a lot and just embarass myself), etc. I simply don't know how to get rid of these obsessive thoughts anymore."
276,"Taking Off-brand zoloft, Doc says feeling ""meh"" is normal?",Anxiety,"Finally started zoloft (setraline?) A couple months ago. Recently did a check-up with my doc and I told her I've been feeling a bit more depressed since taking it. I don't have as much interest in playing my favorite games or talking to friends online besides my bff and my bf. Just want to zone out and play phone games all day instead and I kinda hate it; I want to have the motivation to catch up on my favorite games with all the free time I have.

Doc says the medication does this and takes out the ""highs"" with the ""lows"" so it leaves you feeling ""meh"". My bff says she's wrong and I should ask about a new medication, but I might not even need it for much longer, I'm on it because I hate my job so much. What should I do? Is it normal?"
277,Has anyone had symptoms like this?,Anxiety,"It's hard to explain but

when I lay down I feel the blood pulsing in my legs knees arms sometimes I feel it when I'm standing up as well the anxiety has been off the charts lately and I think I'm experiencing physical symptoms.

I'm taking .25 Klonopin almost every day and drinking lots of caffeine I don't know if it's high sodium levels. I'm trying to eat Bland Foods I'm worried that it's my heart but I was just wondering to see if anyone else out there and had this weird symptom

Thanks"
278,I just miss myself.,Anxiety,"In the midst of a very long and dark episode of anxiety and ugh. I just miss the fun loving, carefree, confident person I am when I don’t feel this way. 💔"
279,Violent urges,Anxiety,"I feel shots of anger and disorganized thoughts. This is only occasionally, but it consumes me and wont go away unless I break something/hurt myself/cause sufficient harm to others emotional or otherwise. I dont know how closely this ties in with anxiety but it's my most official diagnosis. I just feel angry and want to destroy things. I try to isolate myself during this time as to not harm others. I dont know how to help it. This occured before taking my antidepressants (fluoxetine) but still persists. Also I have very low empathy for people during this time and actively try to upset them."
280,Im heavily frustrated and need an explanation.,Anxiety,"I do not have anxiety.

My wife has terrible anxiety. It SUCKS man. She never is satisfied with a damn job. She hardly EVER tells me what’s wrong. Nothing. Today she comes home bawling her eyes out. I ask 150,000 times “Love, what is wrong?” Why can’t she just fucking tell me man? Why is it so hard? This shit stresses me out. I’m trying my best here to be calm and supportive but I don’t know how much I have left in the damn tank anymore.Just TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG. She cannot just act helpless like this. I am in no way trying to insult any of you guys here with anxiety. I am sorry, I am just at wits end. I’m guessing it has to do with her hating her job but fuck man she quits and gets a her job so often. Work isn’t supposed to be 100% fantastic. I’m trying to get her in school but she won’t even believe in herself. I try and I try and I try and I try. I do not know what to do. I already have enough stress with being in the Army and her constant not telling me anything is not helping. I’m starting to lose it man and it sucks. Help me help her, please. I love her."
281,I’m letting myself fail bc of my anxiety,Anxiety,"So I had a ten-page-minimum book report due last week that is now late. Every week late is another grade off. I told my professor I’m working on it but tbh...I haven’t started it. These past few days have been terrible on my brain just thinking about what I have to do. Ten pages is just *so much* but it has to be that length or it’s an automatic zero...it’s worth almost a fifth of my final grade for the semester and I have to get it in at some point for *some* kind of grade...I don’t even care what that grade is anymore. Anything feels better than a zero. We were given almost *three months* to do this paper and I’ve done *nothing*.

I tried thinking of a solution, like, designating each page to a 2-hour bracket (20 hours of work split into 10 segments) so that I don’t overwhelm myself thinking about how much work I have to get done, but...every time I think about starting that damn paper my stomach knots up, my body goes cold and my hands start shaking. I can’t believe I’m having this reaction to a *book report*.

I have no idea how I’m going to do this and I’m not expecting any kind of advice so I added the vent flair; I dug my own grave here. I get distracted and keep finding ways to procrastinate so I’m loading my body with caffeine and NSAIDs to ward off headaches so that maybe, just maybe, I can get some work done today. I already feel bad for lying to my professor but I’ve even started considering the “what-ifs” of if I just decide to say “screw it” and just not hand anything in???? 

Idk what to do. I’ve vented to a member of my family about it already and all they had to say was that I have to buck up for what “the real world” has in store. Internally I’m panicking and I feel like a failure. I just wanna give up and sleep it off as an escape, but I also wanna muscle thru it and keep going. *I can’t deal*...

Edit: I’m so close to being done with the paper; the weight is lifting ahhh"

283,I got a puppy and it's overwhelming,Anxiety,"I live with my family and they really wanted a puppy. Our last dog died a few months ago and it was pretty hard on us. So we got this new puppy now and they want me to take care of it. I usually spend my days barely getting out of bed because I'm so depressed, but I'm trying to step up. I went to the store to get puppy food and other things for it, and I haven't been to the store in at least a year. I've tried taking her out several times but she screams like I'm torturing her when I put the leash on. I pick her up and take her out and she barely moves. I have no idea what I'm doing and googling it just says give them a treat when they do something right but I'm like um I literally can't get this dog to move a foot on a leash. Now the dog won't eat and I'm not getting sleep. My family member seems to be happier and I asked them to help me out and they're very apprehensive about it. Life is just a cycle of stress and depression. I don't know how anyone gets through it."
284,what to do,Anxiety,"Hiya! I'm new to the sub and I need some advice or tips. I (16F) have severe anxiety and overthink that my schoolmates think poorly of me. I have trouble reaching out to them to join groups and the only person I talk to is in another section. I don't know what to do so I can feel confident or not worry about what others think of me since I know it's never easy. Any advice will be much appreciated, thank you!"
285,how long to wait before i follow up with someone?,Anxiety,I talked to someone about a tattoo the 25th and was told theyd get back to me soon. I don’t know when soon is? I don’t wanna be pushy either so i’m scared to follow up too soon. Whats a good time to follow up with someone? is 5 days enough? im genuinely terrified of becoming too pushy about this.

288,My girlfriend makes fun of me eating sometimes or makes comments if I ask for food,Anxiety,My gf has bulimia and sometimes when I say I need food she kind of makes fun of me a little bit. Im not really even hungry when I eat though I feel anxious a lot of the time and that makes me feel sick I just eat because its something I have to do. Since she said it I have no want to really eat anymore and it's made me more nervous about asking for food
289,Need some reassurance,Anxiety,"Hi all, 

I’m feeling very anxious and strange right now. I think I know why, I’m absolutely exhausted. I’ve been battling anxiety for the past 10 or so years just for background. 

My dog had a litter of puppies Friday night, we (my partner and I) thought she was going in to labour on Thursday night, so we didn’t sleep very well Thursday. 
Then all Friday morning I was really anxious, I was worried about my dog and whether she’d be okay, and whether the pups would all be okay. 

She finished giving birth around 11pm on Friday, with minor complications during the birth and a scare at one point when she started bleeding quite a bit after I had to pull a puppy out of her that was stuck. I’m happy to say that she’s well now and has settled in to being a mum nicely! 

On Friday I got to bed about 4am, after letting my partner get some sleep, and then was up after about 2 hours - we can’t let the dog or pups out of our sight at the moment as she may sit on one etc and we need to be there to chaperone.

Saturday I wasn’t too bad, was exhausted, emotionally and physically, but I managed to get a cat nap in at lunch time and my partner and I took it in turns watching her all night, getting little 2 hour sleeps in each and then swapping. 

Today I just feel awful. I feel so exhausted, the most tired I have ever felt in my life, and when I’m tired it usually makes my anxiety a lot worse, or at least it’s a lot harder to reassure myself that I’ll be okay. The exhaustion is really hard for me, I feel so strange, physically and mentally. The past 3 days have blurred in to one and I’m starting to struggle. 

Sorry to rant - I feel like I just need some reassurance that things will get easier soon and that I will be able to cope, I really don’t want to let my partner down and I really want to start feeling more in control. I can deal with the anxiety usually, it just feels hopeless today, like there’s no escape from it and like everything’s not going to be okay. 

TL;DR - dog had puppies Friday night and haven’t slept very much in the past 3 days, or the sleep has been very disturbed, and it’s making me feel like my anxiety has got the better of me. Would love some reassurance or tips from anyone who has dealt with this"
290,Why i want to control everything?,Anxiety,"hey, help me anyone who has experience about it

one a week ago i began cardio, it clears my mind and feels good, but my worry wont getting rid. 

when i talking everytimes i trying to control my words and speach looks good... too, i have belief, that i cant to say what is my mind... general i dont have panic attack and no more worry

im on buspirone"
291,I know I should speak to someone,Anxiety,"I sometimes get into these manic anxiety attacks that last for hours when I am alone. Usually I am very irritable a few days before and after.

This happened yesterday and I get this dizziness and pressure in my ears while feeling severe paranoia. I usually soothe myself by rubbing my forearms, pacing and even rocking my body back in forth (similar to self stimulation for autistic individuals).

I also when I get really mad and dizzy sometimes just want to bang my head on something, just to get out of my own thoughts. I don't usually do this because I know it's irrational but I have known to punch walls and hit my own head against things or punch my own head/face in the past. I almost feel like I want to yell for help but that's such a low thing to do but doing these things for attention but I don't know.

These episodes have been happening a lot more often during covid since I am alone sometimes for the whole day. Last time I had some weed to calm down and that really helped but I don't know if it's a good idea to abuse it like that. 

Like I said, I know I need to see someone. My insurance changed on Jan 1st and I get alot better options then so I have been pushing things off but this has been affecting my relationships because I've been being a real dick the past few days with snide comments and such but I feel such a malaise and I'm so irritated with everything.

I have considered maybe a therapy dog may help since pressure and not being alone really helps these things with me.

Can someone offer their experience with something similar and maybe what they think this could be?

Thank you for reading."
292,Experience with “healthy” levels of anxiety?,Anxiety,"Hello all, I’ve questioned for a long time now whether I have an anxiety disorder. I’ve been able to function well enough for the most part, but I would say about 50% of my day, every day, is spent experiencing fear that I can only describe as a tightness in my chest and slight difficulty breathing. Most of my fear right now centers around my job (I’m a new lawyer and feel a lot of pressure to perform), but sometimes it’s just there even when I know intellectually that there’s nothing to be afraid of. My stress is often followed by intense feelings of relief once I get to a point in my day where I feel like I’ve been successful with work or avoided what I was afraid of. This sense of stress and dread has come and gone throughout pretty much all of my life, though it certainly has escalated the last couple years, from what I remember. 

FWIW I’m also 10 years recovered from alcoholism, and have a hard time understanding how my sense of anxiety and stress might or might not be related to that or any other mental condition.

My question basically is: can anyone else here relate to how I’m feeling, is it worth seeking professional help for, and if so where’s the best place to start seeking it? I wasn’t sure whether I should start with a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or other professional. Thanks in advance."
293,Have you ever had muscle spasms that come and go at seemingly random intervals?,Anxiety,"I'm not just referring to muscle twitching, but also just general muscle spasms where the muscle will activate for a couple seconds like on my leg muscles. They don't usually hurt but they are noticeable. Has anyone else experienced these?"
294,I have to be stern with my real estate agent tomorrow and I’m nervous,Anxiety,"Long story short, I have bad anxiety and haven’t followed up a lot with my real estate agent (selling my home.) of course, she’s supposed to follow up with me too but hardly ever does. It isn’t getting any offers or hardly any showings despite being a new and nice home.
I have to call her tomorrow and be assertive because I think she isn’t prioritizing me. I’m just super anxious and feel like I’m going to come off as awkward. I have anxiety in general but phone calls particularly freak me out."
295,"Hyperventilation. Is it really the cliche breathing into a paper bag, or can we do it without even noticing?",Anxiety,"I recently read up on hyperventilation and all the symptoms check out with me. Breathing more than I should and an inordinate focus on taking deep breaths. So now, I'm trying to breathing less and more 'normally', but I'm not actually sure what normal breathing is anymore!

I read the average person takes between 8-12 breaths per minute."
296,What would you like people without anxiety to know about your disorder or symptoms?,Anxiety,As a science YouTube who likes spreading awareness of mental disorders :)
298,Anybody else feel like they can’t enjoy anything knowing they have work again tomorrow?,Anxiety,"I just feel like my anxiety forces me to focus solely on working. I stress over what I’m gonna be doing at work, if I’m gonna struggle with it, how tired I’m gonna be, etc. It’s like it controls me to the core. They say at this job you can “be your own boss” but I don’t know what that means. Never have, never will. I just need to know I’m not the only one who feels this way. I know it’s not normal but it’s me everyday. I had three days off work this week and will on a regular basis from now on but that doesn’t matter. Cause all I can do is think think about how I have four days of work for the week starting tomorrow. And the week after that...and the week after that...and the week after that...until I die."
299,Losing a pet anxiety?,Anxiety,"I’m going through this phase where I’m obsessively terrified of losing my pets. Not as in them passing away, but I’m literally spiraling thinking about them getting outside and running away or me getting carjacked while they’re in the car (this is happening in my city too often).

I’m dreaming about it, obsessing about it, literally laying in bed almost in tears thinking about it while these sweet dumb animals are snoring next to me.

I’m currently pregnant, and I’m already obsessing about the fear of my pets running away when my family watches them when we’re at the hospital. 

(My self diagnosis is this is triggered by being extra attached to them after being home with them 24/7 during a pandemic and obviously the stress that comes with pregnancy in general)

Any advice on how to stop this spiral?"
300,Diagnosis &amp; medication,Anxiety,"Looking for some advice on how you all went about getting a diagnosis/medication for anxiety. For me, I don’t have any kind of formal diagnosis but I know my anxiety is getting much worse and it’s really starting to negatively impact my life. 

Did you go to your primary care doctor? Get a referral to a psychiatrist? I understand the process will vary based on state/country (I live in NY for reference), but generally I’m looking to see what route people have taken. Recently, I called 5-10 psychiatrists in my area to see if they were accepting new patients/if I could make an appointment without a referral and I didn’t get a single call back. I was seeing a therapist but I didn’t get much help from her and stopped going to her for multiple reasons. At this point, I am not sure if I should try to find another therapist and see if they can refer me to a psychiatrist, or if I should see my PCP and see what they recommend. 

Thank you all in advance for your help!"
301,How to deal with anxiety and job searching ?,Anxiety,"I recently moved to a new town to study a foreign language and I love it its been really good for me. My only problem is that my savings are slowly disappearing so I need to apply to part time jobs. I'm good at writing resumes and cover letters and it shouldn't really be a problem for me to apply to several jobs per day, but my anxiety is really holding me back. Everytime I think about applying to a job the anxiety sets in and it just gets worse the more I try to type. I've had super bad experiences with working in the service industry before (am 21) and the idea of feeling so attacked, vulnerable and miserable again is what makes me so afraid. This is really holding me back and I'm wondering if you have any tips for me or just kind words? English is my second language."
302,Feeling Thankful,Anxiety,"Joined this page recently and for the first time in a long time I feel less alone with my anxiety.

I’ve had the number for a therapist in my phone for awhile now and finally feeling motivated to make the call. I hope talking to someone becomes the first step of many in taking back control."
304,Annoyed.,Anxiety,"Recently a ex and I have broken up. 

We also had a fight about a week ago, over one of my friends spreading the pregnancy news around. She freaked out and didn't want to keep it because people already knew now. (That's a crazy reason for not wanting it) So now that we're broken up I understand for not wanting to keep it, but now her friends are talking about she's drinking and getting high for 2.. When she even told me that she would wait till our baby was gone. 

Just so irritated by this woman! I'm so lost, like what do I do? I really do love this girl, but just how toxic and careless/loveless she is.. it's breaking me."
305,Has anyone here had an abnormal ekg/ecg result because of nervousness/panic during the test?,Anxiety,"Long story short i went to my pcp had the ecg and he said i have a right axis deviation then went to urgent care scared out my ass nervous during the procedure and now they said it was my left side? I dont get it?

Plus during the test I was panicking like crazy 120-130 hb’s/min

And not only that the electrode cords were slipping off of me? Like i felt they were not sticking on my chest correctly on both visits

This has been making me freak out doesnt help im a hypochondriac

Had heart tests done in 2018 by a cardiologist and everything came back normal?"
306,WhatsApp or Facebook groups,Anxiety,Are there any WhatsApp (preferable) or Facebook messenger groups or would anyone like to start one of these groups where people with anxiety can chat about how they are feeling and get help from people who understand or even send motivation through? It is tough because no one close to me understands and sometimes I need support from people who do. Please let me know if this exists or if you would like to help make it exist.
307,Intense fear of aging and dying,Anxiety,"Hello, so I am 20M.  Ever since maybe age 19 or so, I’ve gotten this intense anxiety and fear of death.  Not the instant random death like car crashes and things like that.  But the slow death that comes as a part of natural life.  It’s been giving me this constant existential dilemma and fear that I’ll blink and be 80.  Or even worse, reach 40-50 and find out my health is too bad for me to last to my 60’s.  I want to find a way to turn this into a way of living a healthier more fulfilling life style, but a mixture of (*who’d have guessed it?*) anxiety, and ADHD have really held back my progress.  I’m seriously so terrified of time just passing and passing and passing year after year.  I’m scared that one day I will hit my biggest accomplishment, and it’ll be underwhelming, and then I’ll just get older and die.  

I hope all the time and fantasize about the potential idea of by the time I pass on, hopefully 80-90 or so, they’ll have created a way to implant your consciousness into a robot or video game or something where you can basically live like SIMS with the rest of your family, who will join you after they pass on.  I’d give anything for there to be an afterlife where me and my wife and my son and other future kids and grandkids can all just live in a virtual house and spend time together.  That’s all I want.  I want a way for life to extend beyond death and I’m hoping science will be crazy enough by then to do it.

But regardless, I need to figure out how to ease this anxiousness for the present day.  Every night I think about how I’m getting older by the minute, and how I’ll never get this time back."
308,I can't stop worrying,Anxiety,"I worry about litterally everything. It doesn't stop, it doesn't let me enjoy my free time because I always worry about something. I just want it to stop."
309,Does anyone else get anxious/sad about things changing?,Anxiety,"I'm still a teen living with my parents, and I've always lived in the same house. The thought of growing up and having everything change from everything I've ever known seems so daunting and depressing. How do you cope?"
310,Driving...,Anxiety,"Hi all. I’ve been driving for two years now, it’s been fine, I’ve loved it, I love driving with songs playing and singing along and it’s always been absolutely fine. 

However. Recently I started getting panic attacks whilst I was driving because I was feeling dizzy, having heart palpitations and feeling sick. This turned out to be anaemia, which I’m on iron tablets for now and have been for a month, but because of this I have now associated driving with feeling anxious and sick and dizzy and every time I try to drive I physically cannot. I sit there and turn the ignition on and just cannot go forward. I’m petrified. 

Issue is, I work ten/fifteen mins away from my house and need to be able to drive to get there so my other half has been taking me but I hate being an inconvenience and making him do it, and I hate that I feel like I’ve lost my independence. But on the other hand, I just can’t force myself to do something that terrifies me. 

Anyone else suffer with driving anxiety like this? Anybody managed to get over it? Driving used to be my favourite thing and now I actively hate it."
311,My insomnia is back for a visit :(,Anxiety,"Earlier this year I developed a terrible insomnia that lasted a few weeks and was crippling, at exactly the same time I started therapy. It eventually passed, but ever since I have issues sleeping for maybe one night a week. I'm mostly pretty used to it by now and don't stress too much unless it's more than one night a week bc it makes me anxious if I'm constantly tired. However since a bit before Thanksgiving I've started not being able to sleep for more than 7 hours a night, and the last two nights I've been waking up every half hour for almost the entire night (at least at some point yesterday it stopped and I slept straight through, at the moment I'm taking a break from trying to make myself sleep to make this post so I don't know if it'll go the same way yet).

I know I have trauma related to the holidays from growing up with someone extremely emotionally and verbally abusive who was INSANELY controlling about the holidays. I no longer speak to this person, but about once a year she still tries to reach out around this time and demand to come visit even though she's been cut out just to rock the boat and make everybody miserable. Thankfully this year I already know that she's too afraid of the current global health situation to try and pull anything, but I've been talking to my therapist a lot about the concept of ""physical memories"" and how my body was evolved specifically to remember traumatic events for survival purposes. Meaning that even if I don't consciously remember trauma, my body does and is likely to react with fear. So, naturally, despite being completely safe and happy, I'm struggling with anxiety, and thus my insomnia is back.

My point in making this post is just to vent, I guess, and to ask for reassurance that this is gonna pass. My insomnia last time went away, and I'm sure it will this time too. But it's scary and it would help me a lot to hear kind words from outside my own head. Especially when I'm struggling to hear my own positive affirmations over the battlefield replaying in my head this time of year.

Bless you guys ❤"
312,Does something like work anxiety exist?,Anxiety,"Hi there,
I don‘t know if this is the right place to post this. But I’ve been wondering for quite some time now if there are other people out there, having similar problems as me. So here goes:

I am scared shitless of taking up a job, internship, or virtually any sort of productive activity. There is no bigger dread to me than thinking of my inadequacy for the most basic tasks. I get overwhelmed whenever I imagine the tasks I may be confronted with and the various ways in which I could mess up / sth could wrong.
I didn’t have to confront this fundamental fear of mine in the past because my parents were incredibly generous and have supported me for all these years (I’m 20 years old now) - and I greatly appreciate that, I really do. But I feel increasingly guilty for not addressing this issue, esp. because I haven’t made any progress at all. 
The thing is, I wouldn’t even call myself lazy. Whenever I have to do something, I work hard toward succeeding at this task. And oddly enough, I love learning/ studying. I really do. So it doesn’t disturb that this often means putting in a lot of effort. But as soon as it is about the practical application of whatever I’ve learnt, I’m literally paralyzed by fear and can’t think of anything else. 

Can anyone out there relate to this? I’m really desperate right now.

Thank you!"
313,DAE feel like they’re too damaged to ever recover?,Anxiety,"I’m really struggling at the moment - constantly overthinking and worrying and being stressed. I can’t relax or get any rest. I’m convinced I do everything wrong and I don’t seem to be making the right choices. I feel hopeless, worthless, useless. I have had suicidal thoughts (but I have reasons to live that outweigh these). I’ve recently been signed off from CBT as they couldn’t offer me anything else. I don’t understand why I can’t be offered a more intensive therapy. I’ve tried CBT 5/6 times now. It does help for the smaller issues but I’ve got so much going on in my head that I don’t talk about with anybody. I don’t want to live anymore but I don’t want to die. I have a diagnosis of GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) but I also have all of the symptoms of cPTSD (which I think may stem from childhood trauma). I am on anti-depressants but I don’t even know if they work anymore. I don’t remember life pre-medication. I just wanted to get this off my chest really. I’m not expecting any response."
314,How can i overcome my fear of getting a job?,Anxiety,"I am a really socially awkward person. I'm an introvert, a coward, shy, low self esteem, overthinking and have a weak physical. I'm so scared of getting a job with a proper income. I'm afraid of new environment. I think i can manage if i know someone there, but when i'm alone i'm really afraid of it. This is my problem when i try to get a job. I have no friends around to get a job together because they live in different district. I don't have any skills too to do any freelancing. Tbh i believe that i can't survive the working environment in a company. I can't bear the responsibilities that will be given to me or the commitment that they sought from me. I've tried to do coding but i'm not interested. i tried dropshipping but i don't know how to attract customers attention and again i lack commitment. Right now i work as a delivery guy for a small food stall but the income is not enough for a living(only around rm30/day which is about 7usd). Idk what i should do. Do you have any idea how to help me? Is there any job for a guy that has weak physical and has no skills like me?"
315,I've always been afraid of growing old. A few thing have helped recently,Anxiety,I've really been getting into cottage core that glorifies the whole grandma aesthetic. That and watching Howls moving castle helped me too. Sophie just takes getting turned into an old woman with a lot of grace and spunk that I'll hope I have one day
316,I'm sad to see how little CBT is recommended on this sub,Anxiety,"Yes, talking to your doc about meds/a diagnosis is great. Yes, sharing experiences is great. Yes, meditation &amp; breathing are great. Journaling is great. Self care if great. Facing your fears is AMAZING (actually, the BEST!). Going to therapy/counselling is also amazing (if you can access it). These are all GREAT coping mechanisms for your tool box!

That being said, if you've never tried, please do **self-directed CBT** (abundance resources on google - **""CBT worksheets""**). It is recommended to do an hour session once a week for 12-20 weeks. Keep those tools you learn in your self-directed therapy with you throughout your day and *practice, practice, practice*. 

CBT is evidence-based and used to treat a broad range of psychiatric disorders. It has a success rate of 75%+ or higher (and that's just within 12-20 weeks!). 

Remember, you are not in control of your thoughts (we think 1.6 thoughts/second, 99% of them are meaningless). You are in control of your REACTION and your ATTITUDE towards your thoughts. Another tool I use to ask myself: ""Who would I be without this worry?""

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; Please do not let this subreddit be your only self-help tool. Google ""CBT worksheets"" and get started on your self-directed intervention."
317,Fluoxetine and side effects,Anxiety,"My doctor prescribed me fluoxetine, 20mg every morning at the same hour. With Clonozepam that I have to take when I have crisis such as panic attacks. But it’s not my first time being on fluoxetine and I remember that I felt incredibly nauseous and felt kind of drowsy. Now it’s been my second day and I don’t feel anything like that. And I’m scared that my medication is not working since I don’t feel side effects. Or it’s normal and they will show up in a few days after taking it?"
318,I cleaned the house!!,Anxiety,"May be stupid but it terrifies me to clean because the dust and cleaning products may or may not trigger an asthma episode. But, if I don't clean dust accumulates and I guarantee asthma episodes. I'm normally stuck here but today I put my big girl pants on I put on some music, wore my face mask and got to the deep cleaning duty. I just finished and am so tired and happy!! Everything smells nice :3"
319,New-thing anxiety leading to procrastination.,Anxiety,"I’m a trainee lawyer, and I love my job. It’s challenging, but I get to work with amazingly intelligent people and get to learn something new every day. I’ve also always been an anxious person, but by and large I’ve been able to manage anxiety for the past through years through a combination of mindfulness, exercise and lexapro.

However, I am prone to putting off certain tasks for as long as possible, even when in theory they are tasks I should enjoy doing. I’ve never really been able to understand this part of my own brain until recently.

I realised I don’t really ever put off tasks that which are very difficult or unpleasant; instead I tend to put off tasks if I don’t clearly know how to do them. If I can’t immediately determine the first step in a task, the anxious part of my brain wants to file it away until some future time when the first step is clearer. I’m by no means lazy - I’ll happily work 12 hour days - but tasks with undefined steps often get ignored. 

The hardest part of being productive, for me, is sitting down with a problem I have no idea how to address and figuring out how to manage it. Even now, I’m looking at my to-do list and there are some incredibly complex tasks that I feel fine with - like drafting a multi-million euro contract, while there are other much simpler and less time consuming tasks that make my stomach churn when I think about them. Getting over that period of initial stomach-churning ‘I am so fucking lost’ feeling is the single biggest problem I have when it comes to professional and personal productivity and the biggest source of anxiety. This is hard, because my job requires me handling new things on an almost daily basis.

Does this form of anxiety/procrastination resonate with anyone else? Have you found a good way to combat it?"
320,"I have sever anxiety, and i want to go on walks in the morning...",Anxiety,"I have sever anxiety, and i want to go on walks in the morning. But right when i wake up and take a shower and put clothes on, I cant get myself to do it. Any advice? My habits of staying inside have gotten really bad since march."
321,I feel I will never be enough for people without anxiety.,Anxiety,"I’m really struggling at the moment. I’m so sick of feeling useless and not worth the oxygen for being unable to do things others do without even thinking. I couldn’t go to work today, I made myself so unwell because of it. I do it all the time with so many things. I am forever letting my anxiety talk me out of things and I feel so ashamed and worthless for it. 

I just want to be able to go to work and my only thought be “ugh my shift is so long” like everyone else. I just want to make my son proud.  I want my partner to stop rubbing in my face that he is the only one working. 

I just want anxiety to go away for good and it breaks my heart knowing that it will never ever happen. I am broken forever. I will never be enough to people who do not understand. 

Everyone else who is having a really tough time, just know that I am proud of you. I’m proud of you for going on when everything sucks and you literally feel like you’re dying. I’m proud of all your little achievements that everyone else overlooks or thinks it’s not a big deal. I’m so proud of you for fighting this awful mental enemy that prevents you from living how you want to."
322,I don’t think I’m ready for a job?,Anxiety,"Hi, thank you for reading this.
like so many young adults, getting a job is one of the biggest challenges in your life. Every since I was 17 I sought after a job and always come out flat. I applied for a movie theater and the employees told me to go home and expect a phone call. I never got it. (Well maybe I did and was just too anxious to answer it? I don’t know) By my 19th birthday my dad took me to a fast food joint. It was my first interview and I was hired on the spot, but I was told to wait for a phone call and they never called me back. Than I try several grocery stores, the last was an hour and a half away from my house and after several interviews the people told me to wait for a phone call. Guess what? No phone call.

After that episode I decided to try out some stay at home jobs like  blogging and freelance writing but they didn’t turn out as I expected. I watched hours of YouTube videos with thumbnails telling me I can make hundreds of dollars a day doing nothing and they were all big lies. I even try to work with my fathers business at home but the only position he had for me was supervising his social media accounts which was boring.

Finally I decided I’ll do twitch streaming but I needed to wait all year to get a good functioning computer and microphone. after much hesitation, I put in under 10 hours of gameplay on the site and made The discovery that streaming just wasn’t for me.

I was really upset, all of that wait and complaining was for nothing. “Where do I go from here?” I asked myself. How do I support myself while also pursuing my dream of becoming a bestselling writer?

My parents assured me not to worry too much, they’ll support me with whatever job I can find and that they won’t kick me out of their home or anything like that. however, they did highly recommend that I get something worth a good resumé like being a waiter or going to college for a higher education and those things I’m not interested, especially since I’m kind of a introvert. 


Now I am here, writing this piece for strangers like you while sad &amp; worried about my future. Whoever’s reading this, please give me some help, weather it’s advice or some kind of motivation,  I need is something- anything..."
323,Was trying to explain to someone how to phrase things,Anxiety,"Thursday I got triggered. Hard.

Hyperventilated after it all and was gagging while crying so hard.

Friend who told me they understand how high anxiety works because their sister has it proceeded to tell me that they were not going to learn how to explain things to me. That sometimes no is good enough and I would have to deal with it. That learning how to speak to me was akin to lieing and coddling and they weren't going to do that. There was nothing they could do to help me so I'd just have to 'deal with it'. 

I've never had an attack so badly. The next day I had stomach aches. For someone who says their family is so anxiety ridden why the hell would they do that?"
324,Why can’t I sleep past 5:40am?!,Anxiety,"For the past several weeks, alongside a peak in work stress, I’ve been waking up early between 5:30 and 5:40. Always in that 10 minute window. I’ve always been early to bed, early to rise, but this is getting a bit ridiculous. I wouldn’t mind but I can’t get back to sleep after I’ve woken up and it’s getting to the point now that it’s making my anxiety worse because all I want to do is be able to sleep in because I am exhausted. 

I go to bed at around 23:00 and have no trouble at all dropping off (never have - my mind is so worn out with worries by the end of the day!) so it isn’t as though I’m not getting enough sleep. I had a phone appointment with a doctor on Friday who has prescribed me beta blockers for the physical anxiety symptoms I’m having and I’m going to be starting a 10 week CBT course soon. I’ve tried all the things they tell you to: no phone, no sugar, no caffeine, no alcohol, no smoking, meditation... I just want to wake up feeling like I’ve had a proper night’s sleep 😴"
325,Chest Pains,Anxiety,"Hello everybody, I’m a 19 yr old female and for the past 7 months i’ve had extremely bad anxiety. I’ve been to the doctors a few times over the course of this year with worries i had some respiratory issue but was always told it was just anxiety. I wake up feeling as tho i can’t take a deep breath; even when i can it doesn’t satisfy me. i’m constantly yawning and i tend to breathe with my chest which causes chest pains all the time (which doesn’t help with my anxiety lol). i have not been prescribed any meds, i do have an inhaler but that doesn’t seem to help. if anyone has any techniques they use to get thru anxiety attacks or breathing please lmk!"
326,Lost in space,Anxiety,"Sometimes I get so afraid of dying

327,"If you’re suffering, The Dare Book is your friend.",Anxiety,"Yesterday I posted to this subreddit feeling hopeless and like I was about to break. 

Just from cruising the Reddit I kept seeing suggestions for the DARE book. Let me just say, I’ve been working on my recovery for a few years now and the steps in the book were something I thought I’d never EVER attempt. 

Last night when my normal middle of the night anxiety showed up, I applied the tools from the book. Since I was accustomed to my bout, I went in and embraced my panic and like a can of raid it began to retreat.

[PDF here](https://media.voog.com/0000/0044/2088/files/Dare_%20The%20New%20Way%20to%20End%20Anxiety%20..%20by%20Barry%20McDonagh.pdf)

You can save it to your phone but I also purchased the book from Amazon.

If you’re looking for help, this book was a giant tool. You can beat this and not be a prisoner of your body!"
328,Can you pinpoint in your life an event that seem to be related with the beginning of your anxiety ?,Anxiety,"In my introspection process, I realized that I wasn't anxious as a kid and even as a teenager. I think my anxiety developed around 22 or 23yo.

It's weird and I haven't talked to this to my psychiatrist (will do next session), but it seem to stem from an emotional trauma I had at this age. Or maybe it's just a coincidence as my mom developed her GAD around the same age. 

Since it happen many years ago, is there a chance of recovering from such event?

Anyone in similar situations?"
329,About work.,Anxiety,"So it's been a recurring gripe with my retail job that I am not the most engaging person. I highly prefer to just scan and work on peace. I've failed a secret shopper just cause I didn't greet someone I was helping while being laser focused on bagging and catching up. 

Today I was tired af and I guess a  corp person told my boss I'm not the friendliest. I know of all people you guys would get how hard it is to talk to someone you don't know especially after being ignored enough times.

How do you guys manage to engage?"
330,I'm worried,Anxiety,"Hey guys,
Basically I've been having worrying thoughts about hurting others and myself and it's causing me great distress. I would never hurt anyone else and it makes me feel as if I'm evil. is it me being secretly evil or is it a type of anxiety I really want to know"
331,Can anyone relate to my anxiety journey?,Anxiety,"So i always had some anxiety my whole life, but it was never too debilitating. I was popular, highschool quarterback, etc.. Then my first gf cheated on me and messed me up but still i was able to handle it. Then during college i had a heartbreak with a girl that drove me insane to the point of not eating or being able to get out of bed. Since this my anxiety has expanded from not just girls, but all possible things in my life. All things that i once used to be okay with, i became super fearful of. I became a hypocondriac, afraid to fly, afraid to exist, afraid to love. Since i developed all these fears, they all seemed to come true. Since i became a hycondriac i became physically ill and weak for no reason because i am constantly convincing myself that im dying lol. Then i developed depersonalization and feelings of being in a dream. And now im at where i am now, a fcking mess. So is the girls the cause of it? Or was this something inside me regardless."
332,Asking anyone to share their experiences with Propranolol,Anxiety,"Hi all, Ive experienced heart palpitations that have manifested into prolonged bouts of arrhythmia for a while now, on top of this I have developed anxiety arising from the constant worry about my heart health, I've tried a few medications with varied results but none seem long term solutions. I've recently been summoned as a witness in a court case and am looking for something to really ease my symptoms in such a stressful situation, I've recently been prescribed Propranolol by my doctor and would like to hear about peoples experience with it, if it was effective and if any long term side effects occurred?"
333,Anxiety eating my ass,Anxiety,"Fibromyalgia Causing Heart Attack Anxiety

So my fibro decided that it would attack only the left side of my chest, my left arm, neck, and back.

I’ve gone to the ER so many times and have had so many ekgs, and blood work. And yet I’m sitting here, wondering, if I’m having one.
It’s exhausting, this thought process and I’ll sit around thinking about all the ways I’ll keel over and die because I won’t know the difference.  

And it doesn’t help that my anxiety is bad enough to make my chest hurt anyway, and makes me short of breath. 

And I’m trying so hard to fight going to the ER, I haven’t been in months, because I knew I had to stop. Cause damn, how many times do I need to see the ER doctor before I realize , I’m not dying..

The whole time I've dealt with the diagnosis I constantly think that there's nothing wrong with me, even though multiple doctors have confirmed. Is this normal? Is there way to stop feeling like this? It's really been hurting my ability to seek help as I feel like I don't deserve it. Any advice helps :)"
335,How do you deal with anxiety caused by family when you are trapped with them?,Anxiety,"I'm on Zoloft to help with it but my family is one of the main causes of my anxiety and they keep asking me why it doesn't seem to work. I consider them emotionally and verbally abusive. When i tried to tell them they are one of the main reasons i'm a nervous wreck, they just call me sensitive, selfish, or just laugh like i just told a joke. I don't have any friends to go to, and the pandemic means i can't really go out anywhere. So what are some ways to try to deal with my nerves? I mainly try to isolate in my bedroom with the door shut and wearing headphones with music playing to try to drown out everything."
336,Hey people I'm 15M and I want to be less nervous in every corner of my life.,Anxiety,"How do I do it? I 𝙢𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙡𝙮 want to be more confident(or less nervous) while speaking to strangers, High-authority people e.g my school principal, and speaking to people on phone calls.

My articulation is terrible as my brain speaks way faster my mouth. Also, how can I work on this?"
337,Confused,Anxiety,"I want to go see a therapist, but I am not sure what exactly I feel or what is wrong with me. I am not sure WHY I want to go talk to a therapist I just know that something isn’t right with the way I’m feeling.

At the same time I don’t wanna go to a therapist and have nothing to talk about or not know what to say.

Does anyone know what I mean? Any experiences with similar feelings?"
338,Say it,Anxiety,I know it’s November I know it’s the “holiday season” but you know what this isn’t it. I’m not me. I’m not even in my own body. I feel like someone is inside my body and I’m watching from far away. I feel like a shell and like a mess. My whole world is falling apart and on top of that I have to fix my apartment by myself. Maybe a bottle of wine will fix it. But I can’t keep having meltdowns like this so hi. How’s your Saturday
339,Does Snapchat make anyone else feel anxious?,Anxiety,"I realized I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to using Snapchat. I noticed it really becoming prominent in two ways. 

First, when I Snapchat several people the same thing, and they all ignore it, I start spiraling thinking that I sent them something inappropriate, like an inappropriate photo or something rude or mean. I don’t keep inappropriate photos on my phone, I think the worst case is I have some “before” photos of myself as I am trying to be healthier. But I make this connection that because they all opened it, I sent something they perceive as bad. 

Second, whenever my husbands friends Snapchat me something, for some reason this gives me a lot of anxiety and I spiral as well when they don’t reply to what I send them. I have always placed too much value in what his friends think of me. I don’t know why I worry about his friends so much. 

I don’t know why I get so much anxiety from this app. I want to do the quick fix and delete the app. But I also don’t know if that is the most productive thing I can do to deal with my anxiety. Tips?

Does anyone else get anxious and thought spiral from this app??? I feel so stupid and it would be great if anyone had advice or can also share their experiences 😞 I appreciate it"
340,My anxiety in class gets worse when watching zooms/ videos,Anxiety,"Whenever I’m in class and my teacher shows videos, my anxiety gets so much worse. I find that I get so much more fidgety, my heart beat goes through the roof and my throat closes up. 

Maybe it’s just that I have to put all of my focus onto one thing- Does anyone else have this experience?"
341,Panic attacks after blacking out,Anxiety,"A week ago, I accidentally blacked out from alcohol. I never black out because of the anxiety it gives me the following day, but now my anxiety tied to this night has lasted for a whole week.

I am worried because I blacked out with my roommate's family friend. My roommate is also my best friend. Although I don't remember anything that happened at the end, (I believe the total blackout happened about 30 minutes towards the end), I now have this anxiety that I said bad things about others or possibly even said something bad about my roommate. I don't know why I have this fear, because I absolutely love my roommate to death, but I know that once I blackout, I can become an entirely different person. For the most part, when I black out to that extent, I can become pretty silent because my brain stops processing entirely.

My roommate said that when she saw me after I came back inside, I was very slow and hardly able to answer her questions. She even said I fell and hit my head on the wall, which left no injury, thankfully. Her family friend also never mentioned anything the following day, except for the fact that I blacked out, so he walked me back home. Is it just likely that I am creating these fears in my mind? And how do I deal with them?"
342,it’s too fucking much right now. Too fucking much.,Anxiety,"literally every day is just burning fear. awful pain. everyone around me hates me and treats me like shit, I fear for my safety constantly. I’m so fucking done. Someone please give me something other than generic, worthless advice to hold onto cause I’m falling apart"
343,anxiety is so exhausting,Anxiety,"this probably could’ve been flaired as venting as wel but,

Anxiety is so incredibly exhausting i’m sure we can all relate and unfortunately know first hand just how tiring it is but man this year has been so brutal

I’m truly exhausted with everything that goes on in my head especially with things leaning towards hypochondria. It honestly become so debilitating and tiring having to convince myself i’m not dying just because my hip hurts or some irrational shit. Would very much appreciate a break from my brain."
344,An epiphany about control,Anxiety,"(TW: Mention of suicidality)

I just had an epiphany, thanks to someone who messaged me after I posted to r/SuicideWatch.

My traumatic infancy (fraught with uncontrollability and unpredictability) set the stage for my GAD, and at the heart of that has always been my absolutely desperate need for control. I think that this need goes deeper than I realized. Because now that I think of it, the majority of my maladaptive responses to things are *all about control.*

Right now, there are so many things in my life that I can't control. I am used to panic attacks and physiological anxiety, but I realize now that even my suicidal feelings and impulses come from that control aspect. First, if I can't control an outside thing/person, then at least I can control my life and pain (hence self-harm); and second, I don't want to escape life, I just want to escape the crippling anxiety (masked in anger, sadness, depression, etc.) that is caused by not being able to control everything. Everything that triggers me, everything that is making me so high-strung and dysregulated and unstable and driving my emotions mad, comes down to not being able to control.

I also realize that I have a pattern of letting things beyond my control, control ME. Instead of taking ownership of the things I *can* control, I allow things I *can't* control to define and command my emotions. For years I did this with self-worth: I still hate that I can't control others' opinions of me (i.e. that people can dislike me even if I didn't do anything ""wrong"" or it was a misunderstanding, and I can't change their mind), but I used to therefore allow others' opinions define how I felt about myself. Why? Because I am obsessed with having control. Control is safety and security. Control used to be the difference between life and death--and lack of control was a threat to my life.

Ultimately, my problem is not being able to find happiness when I can't have control, and/or struggling to find smaller things I *can* control even when I can't make everything picture-perfect. I don't know how to be happy or content if there is something in my life that makes me unhappy and I know I'm powerless to change. I'm a rigid thinker, and I have trouble seeing that I could still be happy if I adjusted my perception of a situation, or the importance I assign something, or my expectations. In a workplace capacity, I'm a very creative and flexible thinker and problem-solver. When it comes to my mental health, not at all. Objectively, I know I can either accept that I can't control it (monumentally easier said than done) or leave the situation altogether (also monumentally easier said than done, sometimes). Subjectively, it's hell.

I don't know, I just felt like sharing this. Perhaps it can offer perspective to anyone else here with comorbid issues. It took some time to connect my depression/suicidality/other problems to control, but now I see it much more for what it is."
345,How to control this from happening?,Anxiety,"I find myself getting anxiety when I start talking to a higher up employee at work.

At times I get nervous and don’t know how to keep a conversation going. I’m afraid I’ll say the wrong thing or my words won’t come out how I see them in my head.

Sometimes when I’m talking to someone in a higher position, I get anxious and my mind goes blank. 

I can have a basic conversation with my employees since I’m a manager but when it comes to the higher ups I get nervous and just clinch up.

I’m calm on the outside but on the inside I’m nervous or feel like I’m being judged by anything I say.

Is this normal and how can I get better at handling this or even removing it from my everyday life?"
346,Separation anxiety?,Anxiety,"I fear the death of my loved ones, mainly my mom and dad.

I live with my mom, she's 65, have had an aneurysm 15 years ago but she still smokes. That makes me super scared.

My dad lives relatively close to me, but I don't see him enough. Ain't in touch with him the much as I would like to. But I don't know how to build that. 

I lost my grandma last year and just lost my dog this week.

Yesterday the whole 'separation anxiety' thing stroke me hard. I always have to wait till I'm super sleepy to actually sleep and try to take my mind of things (watching something, playing some game..) while that doesn't happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of feeling this way.

I'm almost 30 now, I remember how I was in my early 20s and dudes! That was so much lighter....

T\_T

I KNOW the theory of things, the do's and the dont's... But I don't know how to ""internalize"" this knowledge.

That freaks me out. 

I'm not ready to lose more people. I don't want to. I'm tired of feeling depressed and anxious."
347,Battling Anxiety and Cancer,Anxiety,"Hi, 25 Male

This is my first reddit post and I need to vent. Life has been very tough for me in the past 3 years. I was diagnosed with cancer in 2017, had chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.

Around early 2019 (cannot remember exactly when), I had my first panic attack. I have been having panic attacks and feeling a sense of mailaise ever since on a daily basis. I have managed to control panic attacks but the sense of anxiety, is the worst feeling I have ever felt. This is my life on a daily basis:

Go to a medical appointment? No worries here some anxiety.
Excercising? Heres some anxiety
Contemplating? Heres some anxiety
Working, Meeting? Anxiety on the way
Coffee? Nonono, heres more anxiety
Driving alone? Hellll yeah, heres some numbness all over your body, dizziness, racing heart and ringing ears.

I've done it all, meditation, acupuncture and anything else you can imagine. I refuse to take anxiety medication. I just don't want to die. 

Wish you all the best and thank you for reading."
348,Feeling Sad,Anxiety,Who else is feeling sad today. I have work to finish but I can’t do it and I made my boss upset and that just makes me feel worse
349,Feeling restless,Anxiety,"Hi all, just have question to see if anyone else can relate to me. I have bad anxiety and I am wondering if these symptoms are somewhat normal for someone with anxiety or if this is something different. When anxious I tend to have a lot of nervous ""self soothing"" things, for example, I tend to rub my thumb against my fingers, or fix my hair, rub my chest, bounce my legs, rock my legs side to side, rub my legs, feel itchy and need to scratch and some more. I am wondering if it's normal to have a lot of different ones. I only do these when anxious and when I notice that I am doing them they start to happen more frequently. Wondering if this is normal for someone with anxiety or if it could be something else."
350,How long it takes antidepressants to work again!,Anxiety,"So i ended up having a worst/severe anxiety I ever experienced in my life after tapering off my antidepressants (lexapro), I don't have any memory of me dealing with such crippling anxiety before, I think stopping antidepressants made my anxiety so much worse. 
I restarted my antidepressants a month back, I am not noticing much of a difference, if I go to my psychiatrist he will put me on different antidepressant as he asked me to come back after a month but to my knowledge lexapro worked great for me and I have to give it a full chance. Please guys it would helpful, if you share insight on how much time should i give my antidepressants to work to call it fair try. I really hoping it to work again."
351,Some bad stuff happened in my neighborhood and I’ve been paranoid for months.,Anxiety,"I was always sheltered, according to my parents, and that finally ended when I was 16. I got to go to a mental health juvenile detention center, and while there, I found out that our neighbors down the street had been killed in a home invasion the day I left. I was just thinking about it non stop. It could have been our home. We could have driven right past it without knowing what was going on. (The murders happened within a 24 hour time frame of me leaving and them being found. They’d either been killed that morning, the same time we were leaving, or really late in the night that day.)

I was just starting to get over this when a man up the street was shot to death in his car. I have no idea why, the motive was never announced. Both of these cases I’ve talked about were solved, but I can’t help but fear it will happen again. 3 murders in my suburban neighborhood in just over a year is a lot to me. I have became so paranoid that I take a gun with me everywhere I go. I know I probably won’t even have time to react if it happens to me, but keeping that gun with me makes me feel safe. I’m so paranoid that I sleep fully clothed and then gun in my pocket; if something happens like what happened to my neighbors, there will be no time to reach for the gun safe. (I don’t keep a round chambered and it is on safety, so I won’t accidentally shoot myself. I know this is not really a safe way to keep a gun, but it makes me feel safe.) I don’t know why I still fear this, I don’t really have a reason to. It’s been almost 9 months since the last shooting in my neighborhood, so I don’t think I should still worry. But I obsess over the probability; it’s rare enough to have a double homicide, but it was right down the street. All 3 were supposedly random, not gang related, not drug related. It was an elderly couple and then a young man. And then there was another, I don’t know why but I can’t get it out of my mind and I don’t feel safe. I just want to have a chance at fighting if it happens to me."
352,FOMO at every step,Anxiety,"I look at train leaving to our nations capital - I want to be there, I see emergency pass by - I want to help..
I look at movie and people are doing something interesting..I want to be there..
Its like I feel I didn't experience much untill now (31y) so I miss something always.. and it gives me hell of an anxiety..Can anyone relate?"
353,I just had a mini panic attack for such a stupid reason,Anxiety,"So idk if this will trigger anyone because I don't know what your life is like but this will mention sexual assault sort of, anyway I am catching up on school work at a friend's house cause they are doing something and it is about vaccines, I was reading through them and there is special occasions like if you have allergies and what not and one of the vaccines said ""History of sexual abuse or assault: start at age 9 years"" I was sexually assaulted many times when I was 9 and I guess it set something off in me because I started to cry, shake, and started to like idk how to explain it but all I could see and think was back to when I was being touched against my will and being scared, it's passed over now but I feel stupid that I freaked out because of a few words"
354,Anyone else?,Anxiety,"Does anyone else have to turn off their notifications when texting a friend/family member or when in a group chat and sending messages? Like, I always have to turn my ringer off or else I have  m a s s i v e  anxiety when my phone rings or buzzes... Completely freaks me out. 

Then sometimes I'll miss their message (other times I don't because I will stare very intensely at the screen awaiting their response). It's great, I LOVE texting 👍🥲"
355,How do you stop overthinking mistakes?,Anxiety,"Hey guys, to start off I want to say I've dealt with anxiety in my past but recently it's calmed down a lot. Still there sometimes though. So I just started a new job as a ramp agent at an airport and I made an oopsie at work today. My hat blew off during the pushback phase and the engines were running. It didn't go in, but almost did. The pilot had to stop the engine, wait another 2 minutes for it to start etc; I felt like an ass. Obviously this is a big mistake that could've been worse but now my anxiety is on 100% because I keep going over the scenario in my head over and over. And I keep asking myself questions like ""Are the pilots mad at me?"" ""Is my supervisor mad at me?"" ""Am I going to be the butt of a joke at work now"" etc. I've heard to try and think about the positives and I have been. The aircraft did depart on time (early, actually), did it get sucked in and cause damage? No. Etc etc. But it's not easing my mind. My supervisor told me to shake it off and didn't seem mad but I tend to overthink a lot. What are your guys ways to stop overthinking mistakes? Especially ones that could've been very bad. Sorry for the long post, wanted to explain all the details."
356,"My brother can’t be alone, he said he feels so empty, and when he’s at work, one of us has to be home, I wish I knew how to help him, anyone deal with this ?",Anxiety,Thanks :/
357,Weed/cart induced anxiety attack?,Anxiety,"Long story short I took a 3 day thc break, smoked twice felt okay on thanksgiving, yesterday I hit my cart like normal for the first time that day and my heart rate shot up and felt like it was going 1000 miles per hour I also felt like I had afib from it, usually I get a little tight in the chest from it but never like this. Even after the initial attack my anxiety levels have been thru the roof constantly throughout the day putting my hand on my chest etc. btw this is legal carts from dispensary’s, idk what to do about it cuz even now I wanna check my heart rate lolol. I know the simplest answer is to just not smoke but I’ve been able to enjoy marijuana for the longest with no issues, maybe a few attacks when I first started but that’s really it. Could this be from just taking a break now my body is readjusting to being high?"
358,SSRI experiences/alternatives due to intolerance for Agoraphobia with Panic Disorder?,Anxiety,"Howdy,

I suffer from C-PTSD comorbid Agoraphobia with Panic Disorder. I also have an intense fear of vomiting. I relapsed into agoraphobia while going through a divorce during the pandemic (that I'm still going through as of this date).

Also, although not an official diagnosis, I strongly believe I suffer/suffered from Post Infidelity Stress Disorder, which is due to being cheated on, gaslit, manipulated and so on (which I've managed to mostly recover from as of this date).

The first two weeks after the divorce decision was made, I could not be alone and my partner took off work for two weeks to stay at home with me. Two months later and I'm able to be at home alone just fine, and I'm able to drive within a few miles of my home.

Specifically, I'm here for medication advice. My doctor tried Paxil at a very low dose last June (which I only took 1/4th of the minimum therapeutic dose). I had night sweats, night terrors, and extreme anxiety on this medication; along with seething rage. We tapered off slowly and I tried CBD for a few weeks with little noticeable impact.

Sidenote, weed just causes me to immediately go into a panic attack (but didn't used to, but I wasn't agoraphobic last December).

I've started Lexapro two nights ago at half the minimum dosage. I'm nauseous constantly and I experienced a panic attack at home like I haven't experienced for months last night. My head feels buzzy and I'm more anxious on this medication.

However, I have started to try using Xanax, which I've had since 2016 and only took once up to this point. I have an rx for 0.5mg and I'm finding 1/4th of a pill is enough to knock out my anxiety so it's tolerable (even last night when it was severe), 0.125mg.

While I know that continued exposure therapy, meditation, good diet and exercise will eventually dig myself out of this hole, considering last time I relapsed it took me two years to get out... what are some other medications I can suggest to my doctor to try? I get that I need to be gentle and understanding with myself, but I'm becoming irritated because I was traveling to Key West, flying across the country just last year and now I'm lucky to be a block away from home.

As useful as I've found Benzos, I'm really reluctant to take them period due to the tolerance and dependency profile.

Am I just super sensitive to medication and need to try an even lower dosage of Lexapro? Do I just need to tough out an SSRI until I know what it's like after 4-6 weeks? What about a beta blocker? I also have slightly high blood sugar and blood pressure.

I'm going to start looking for a good cognitive behavioral therapist come Monday. I was just getting started with an EMDR therapist before the pandemic hit, but they've stopped all visits due to the pandemic. I was using Betterhelp up to just recently.. but didn't find much value in it.

Thank you for any guidance!"
360,Small steps,Anxiety,"Typically with school work, and especially with math, I get so frustrated and anxious at assignments that i'll stop working on them and wait until they are late to finish. However, for some reason today i've been extremely productive(by my standards at least lol) and i've bulldozed through a lot ofassignments. I gotta say, it feels pretty good. I know this is really small but im still super proud of myself. Now I just need to do this consistently."
361,Going out with mates,Anxiety,"Anyone else feel like your being set up when you go out with your mates for a meal or out drinking. As in you think that your going to turn up and no one is there. Every time I make plans, I feel like I’m going to get stood up even though it never happens."
362,"27M ADHDer with previously diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder, looking for advice on how to deal with chronic/paralyzing overwhelm",Anxiety,"Hi guys, I visit r/ADHD a lot because it’s my main diagnosis but I wanted to get some insight on how you guys deals with chronic overwhelm (TL;DR at bottom because this is a longer post). I’m diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive type and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in my teenage years. My psych evals from elementary school diagnosed me with “ADHD with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and preoccupation with worry”. I am take medication for my ADHD (Vyvanse 40mg daily) but have never been medicated for anxiety. I have been in long-term therapy for the last year and a half. Due to some of my past struggles with job/school performance, my anxiety mostly occurs when it’s related to “what I need to do/should be doing”. 

I use a bullet journal to keep a list of the things I need to do on a daily/monthly/someday-in-the-future basis. It helps me stay organized but it also puts me in a chronic state of overwhelm. I constantly reflect on how much I want to do in life and I feel like I’m always behind. My ADHD makes it difficult to start even short-term tasks so my long-term tasks usually end up getting put on the back burner. When I am able to start a task, my perfectionist tendencies make it difficult to finish them in any reasonable amount of time. So a month will go by and I’ll look back on my monthly “future goal” list and I just get completely overwhelmed because 75-85% of my monthly goals didn’t get done. 

I know there are a lot of factors here, some of it is probably me being too ambitious with my goals and not being realistic about the free time I have. On the other hand, I know I get easily distracted and I can throw away 4 hours no problem. Whether it’s with obvious time-wasters like video games, or “seemingly productive” tasks like writing the perfect email to a client. Either way, the results are the same in that I spend almost 100% of my day worrying and ruminating about what “should be doing”. These thoughts are conscious and I’m cognizant of them even while I’m engaging in a time-wasting activity watching (playing around on phone, Netflix, etc.). And because I take longer than the average person to complete basic tasks, my day usually ends with me berating myself for not doing what I set out to do. For example, I wanted to cook dinner tonight. I told myself all day I would cook. I played video games and played around on my phone while telling myself I needed to cook dinner for hours and never ended up making it. That is a typical day for me. Ruminating about doing a task while (seemingly) compulsively engaging in a time-waster, which ultimately leads to unhappiness and stress while doing the time-waster, leading to even more overwhelm, as well as regret and guilt/shame. Not very productive! 

I’m working on a lot of this in therapy which helps. Most of what we work on is behavioral and incorporating good habits i.e. good sleep, daily exercise, wait healthy, etc. which have all gotten better. I just can’t shake the constant feeling of chronic overwhelm and feeling like I’m always behind in my day-to-day and with my future goals. As I said before, I visit r/ADHD a lot but haven’t visited this subreddit very often and I’m just hoping to get some insight. Do you guys experience anxiety in this way as well? What have you guys found that helps with coping with these feelings? I’ve never been on anxiety meds but sometimes (more often than not) the overwhelm is so strong that it’s paralyzing. Any feedback or insight is appreciated 😌

TL;DR- ADHDer in therapy and chronically overwhelmed, mostly by seeing my “to-do” lists, to the point where it becomes paralyzing and I will waste time while simultaneously ruminating about the tasks that I should be doing instead. Looking for advice on how to cope with these feelings and not be as hard on myself for not having all of my “to-do’s” done. Interested in how medication has or hasn’t helped you guys with chronic overwhelm and if so which medications you found helpful (and not helpful)."
363,Trying New Things,Anxiety,"I’m in highschool band, and I absolutely love it of course, but I’ve always been real hesitant and anxious about trying new things.

I've been using the arm more the past couple days so OBVI ITS GUNNA BE SOREEEE.

a few hours ago my mum told me that we would be getting santa photos as a family which i thought ""yeah, that won't be too bad"". when i was getting ready, i looked in the mirror and realised just how fat and ugly i was and i broke down and started having a panic attack and my brain started shouting at me all the horrible things people might say to me and all i could think about was how people would view me. whether that be my weight, height, my body, my face or even if i said the wrong thing. my whole room looked like it was caving in on me and all i could do was cry. my mum kept calling my name from downstairs until she eventually came up to my room and the only thing she had to say to me was ""what's the matter? seriously? ok then that's fine we're leaving"" and now i feel this awful feeling in my stomach of emptiness and guilt. 

is there something wrong with me or does this happen to everyone? and how can i stop being so worried about how people view me?"

I’m glad it’s been during COVID and not any other year because I’ve spent most of this year in my home anyways. 

I’m wondering if this has anything to do with it but since 2019, I’ve lost a bit of weight (nothing concerning) from being out of college and eating healthier. I was 175 in college at 5’11 and now I float around 165-167 depending on the day. I’ve lost a bit of muscle since I stopped working out and now I put all my time to music. I spend a lot of my time inside writing and practicing and when it comes to going to social situations I get nervous because of my introvertedness. 

I can’t ride in Uber’s anymore because I feel trapped and can’t get to a bathroom, I especially can’t ride them with people because it makes me feel claustrophobic. 

Whether I’m going 5 minutes down the road or 20 minutes down the road it’s just too long for me. My body instantly goes into fight or flight mode, my inner body has a panic attack and I immediately feel like I need to use the restroom or else I will pee myself. And my biggest fear in life is peeing myself or pooping myself around friends. 

I have been given medication that cuts off my need to urinate and I can take it with alcohol but it still just isn’t good to always be on. I’ve taken my friends anxiety medication before and I feel back to normal but when I’m not on anything it’s tough for me to be locked away in a car and feel trapped. Even if I went to a bar and had 1 beer and went to the bathroom before I left, I’d still get that feeling in the car.

It sounds silly, but I miss the days where I use to be able to be drunk and hold it and never have to worry about any of this happening and now I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to go on stage again due to this feeling. I only feel normal when I’m at home or in the car with parents. Otherwise I’m always on my medication. 

What do I do? Has anyone experienced anything similar?


TL:DR I get terrible anxiety, claustrophobia, and panic attacks when I’m out of my comfort zone and in social situations that keeps me from enjoying what I use to never having a problem doing and it makes me need to pee instantly from fight or flight mode. Where do I go from here and fix it?"
375,Dentist/teeth fear,Anxiety,"Anyone else have a Bad fear of dentist and things related to teeth. I am constantly freaking out over my teeth. I had a filling filled 4 times before it finally was done properly to stay. Then I had a chipped tooth filled less than a week after a bad accident and was told to suck it up when I cried at the dentist. I have since had 4 crowns put in to cover up those poorly filled chips. 2 of those teeth had to have root canals now and I’m soon to find out if I have to have implants. I live in constant fear of my teeth falling out, of the dentist ,of being put to sleep at the dentist... I’ve had nightmares of all my teeth falling out since I was very young. Anyone else have this anxiety? Please help! At this point I don’t even know if my teeth constantly hurt or if it’s my anxiety. I also constantly tense my jaw which doesn’t help the pain"
376,Boss at work,Anxiety,I sent a message to my boss explaining my situation and why I’d been off work due to my anxiety. He knows I do have anxiety issues and I’d really struggle to speak to him about it in person. I’d said sorry as I’ve missed a few days off work and has completely ignored me. I’m very worried to go back to work tomorrow now.
377,Panic attack venting,Anxiety,"So I’m usually quite shy but I was watching a tiktok live and some girl was really drunk and used the N word so I commented saying she shouldn’t have done that and she denied saying it, muted me and everybody else said she didn’t except for the odd few people

Basically everyone attacked me telling me to leave her alone and that I just want a reaction and now I’m so anxious I wish I hadn’t commented it was stupid of me

I don’t know why I’m shaking over something so stupid"
378,Need a little encouragement,Anxiety,"I’m home alone tonight and I’m gonna order in. I have to call and afterwards walk to pick it up. I have lots of issues with this. 
Making the call is scary enough in and of itself. Eating also makes me anxious, because I always fear I’m going to gain weight. It’s also getting really dark out which I really do not care for either. It’s also a new place I’m ordering from and everything is just really scary right now. I need some encouragement right now. Even just posting this is triggering me.
EDIT:
I did it! Eating now. I had an anxiety attack, and almost passed out from being out of breath hehe. 
It’s very yummy"
379,I’m catastrophizing about being fired but,Anxiety,"He did threaten to fire me.

So, my boss has gotten more and more aggressive over errors. 

Instead of solving it and moving on it’s a drawn out thing where he almost belittles and questions us about why it happened and how it could’ve happened 

He says he hasn’t fired us because he believes in us

But god damn his scolding are awful.

He called me on thanksgiving to threaten my job and give me the weekend to think if I really wanted it. I spent hours crying in bed

We consider each other friends too so it’s another layer. 

I’ve completely dropped off performance wise and made more errors as his increasing scoldings on me and my co worker have continued.

I messaged him to ask how his weekend was cause im afraid of another rehash on Monday. So far read no reply he’s usually fast

He’s called me a liar and feels disrespected  because of a couple misleading responses about tasks cause I panic’d. If i went above him he might lose his mind haha which would be weird when dealing with a friend 

I’ve barely left the house. As the weekend has gone on ive felt comfortable in I’ll slow down and check my work. But yeah I’ve felt incredibly bad, I’m barely eating. 

There’s more to it but my roommate and I would probably be homeless if I lost my job, she’s disabled and I take on a lot of extra rent."
380,I am fed up,Anxiety,"I honestly really don’t have much to say but I feel like I am just meant to feel an insane amount of anxiety all the time. When ever I am feeling better something or someone always has to crush that peace and happiness. I don’t understand, I just want to escape this anxiety. I am exhausted."
381,Why would this trigger me?,Anxiety,"I lost my job very suddenly about two weeks ago. Naturally, my life very suddenly fell into absolute pieces and I kind of zombied through a week of applying to various other jobs. (Although I did get the distinct pleasure of taking a phone interview while picking up my stuff from my former job in front of my boss.) Thankfully, I’m in a job where there are a lot of need and I have experience in both mine and similar fields. Before a week was out, I had two interviews and a job offer. 

Now two weeks in and I have four job offers and people still trying to get me for interviews. I’ve chosen one and while I’m nervous to start...I’m having severe anxiety attacks. I am absolutely debilitated. It can last a couple minutes or an hour. Then I just crash. I can barely eat without feeling nauseous. The only thing I can identify as a trigger is responding to the people who are still offering me jobs/asking for interviews. Why is this triggering me? I can’t even look at the other offers or listen to calls without instantly breaking out in a cold sweat. This is exhausting and even my medication isn’t helping. To make matters worse, I’m not sleeping, and when I do, it’s light and I wake often. I can’t do this. I can’t start job like this. I’m such a mess. I feel so dumb."
382,plane anxiety,Anxiety,i don’t have any anxiety at all until it comes to planes. it’s super super bad and i’m not too sure how to help it. i have a flight coming up and my mom says she has xanax but idek if that would work. i’m scared my anxiety is gonna overcome the xanax. any suggestions?
383,Am I overthinking?,Anxiety,Why do I consistently make an idiot out of myself?
384,[advice] anxiety attack that has happened 6 years ago.,Anxiety,"I have always been an anxious person ever since I can remember, but 6 years ago when I just turned 18 I had smoked weed for the first time and experienced a scary anxiety attack. 
Back then I didn’t know what it was, I thought I was going mad, I was supper anxious for 8 months, felt like I was living my life behind a glass wall, always spaced out, Brain fog and obsessive thoughts. 

The anxiety turned into pure ocd, where I started experiencing unwanted thoughts that lead to even more anxiety, I then went into a therapy and got diagnosed with pure ocd and GAD. I suffered with a certain pure ocd theme for 4 years, I still get the thoughts here and there but I know how to control them and I know what they are now.

My problem is that ever since I have experienced my anxiety attack I have not been the same, my mind is always foggy and I’m spaced out, can’t focus on anything, I’m not motivated, I feel tired all the time. I have a baby and he keeps me so happy my soul wants to do so much with my child, but my mind is stopping me from living my life. I live in my head and can’t seem to get out of it. I just wanna enjoy my life, I  do everything for my child because he’s the only thing that keeps me out of my head, I just wish I could get rid of this brain fog so I could enjoy my life more. I have moments where I feel like my old self, but they don’t last long. 

I wanna be the best mother to my child I don’t want him to ever see me spaced out, I get so upset when I’m tired because I feel like I’m not being good enough for my boy.😭"
385,I feel broken,Anxiety,"My anxiety has been sky rocketed lately. It has been over powering me as a person... it hasn’t been this bad in quite some time id say. Mix that with my depression. Boom. Racing thoughts, racing heart, dizziness, tightness in the chest... mentally... drained, tired, irritable, angry, sad. I’m going to pray to god and hopefully that helps. I feel the worst of the worse. ),:"
386,Backed into a corner,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, 
I am really struggling because luckily my bf and I have come to a conclusion over the recent disagreement we had (it’s like my most recent post other than this one if interested) but my mom really upset me. I was extremely homesick after moving with my bf for his new job, and last night made it get worse. I called my mom today to talk to her about what happened last night and she just straight up shot me down over my anxiety. She called me crazy and said “of course he’s reconsidering being with you because look you’re already going crazy now and that’s how he sees you.” After I was telling her how I wish I didn’t have to have anxiety and depression when everyone else is normal. Her response was extremely cold and made me feel like I have nobody in my court. Literally nobody. I am completely devoted to my mom and for her to be so cold was a punch in the gut. How can you even begin to feel okay when your own mom thinks you’re nuts and a pain in the ass to everyone? I feel so alone and like nobody understands me or even cares to. I wish I could be normal like everyone else but I’m not. I’m so sorry for ranting everyone, I just love this community and need some hugs from the internet strangers that may give a shit."
387,What is causing me nausea and stomachache?,Anxiety,"What is causing me stomachache?

19f. I take 25 mg Zoloft in the morning (more like 11 am), on my third week currently. I used to have really bad digestive issues at the beginning and now they seem to be better cause I can finally eat, but tonight I can’t sleep because my stomach hurts. Why is it hurting? Its like a dull ache right in my middle and it’s almost like it’s full and can’t empty itself or sum. 
I did have a small whiskey tonight, and missed my nightly dose of Trittico bc of it. Could that be the reason? Also today I’ve eaten food but less than usual, like bruschetta with hummus and meat and like cake. Helppp. Health anxiety is spiking currently."
388,Do you have trouble standing up too fast?,Anxiety,"I noticed that since I started having anxiety, I have gotten more likely to feel dizzy after getting up from the couch or bed. I don't get blurry vision or something, I just feel this light dizzyness for a few seconds.

I especially noticed I get this more often (!) when I think about it before or while getting up.

Does someone have these problems too?

Maybe I am just low on iron or something.

Have a nice day! :)


Edit: l~~o~~ight"
389,Anxiety about my job due to Covid,Anxiety,"I tried to see if there was a separate thread to post this under, but the one I found seemed to be fairly old. If this isn’t the right place please let me know.

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years, at one point about 10 years ago I checked myself into an inpatient program and did an intensive outpatient program and was able to get on the right meds and the therapy I needed to manage it. I usually do ok, but right now at work there is a major Covid outbreak among the staff at my work and they are not following the DOH/CDC guidelines for having people stay at home and quarantine. My anxiety about the situation is through the roof. I ended up having a panic attack at work on Tuesday, I was barely able to concentrate and kept going into the bathroom to cry and try to talk myself down. I did my work and left right on time. I ended up calling out Wednesday and Friday as well (I was off Thanksgiving) which caused me to lose my Holiday pay. I am at the point now where I feel like I can’t go back on Monday. I feel afraid and unsafe. I’m doing the things I know I’m supposed to as far as trying to take care of myself, taking my meds, reminding myself what is and isn’t in my control, but at this point I keep crying every time I think about going back. I’m having trouble sleeping and I’m just so stressed. 

I have talked to a few friends but they don’t necessarily understand because they don’t struggle with anxiety so it makes it difficult."
390,"I was depressed, got healed in lockdown . And now i am back to the old self.don’t know how to be a positive person anymore .",Anxiety,"I am so over of lockdown happiness. I was depressed, sad, struggling for a numerous reasons before lockdown happened. I was struggling to live , survive for even a day . Then lockdown was announced. I was staying with my cousins and i focussed all my energy on staying healthy, fit and losing weight. Like everyone else.
I cured my backpain problems , my mental health got a little better because of obvious lifestyle changes.
I was a little happier. I motivated my friends and family to stay fit, make lifestyle changes. I set an example for them. 
I started looking great in best shape of my life.
My routine was bomb . (I used to wake up at 5 am , stay productive and slept early)
I was in peace.


But then suddenly i got diagnosed with pcos .My happiness lasted for just a few months.
I got overwhelmed and tensed .
I started binging over sweets , i read alot of books on pcos but that just worsened my problems.
I couldn’t find a doctor and i started ruining my routine and diet. I used to run. Gradually i started not exercising and now it’s been 20 days since I stopped workouts.
I don’t even like the taste of food . I eat and don’t feel nurtured .I am fat again, back in a mental rut where i can feel every bit of the pain i used to have.
I have no friend and posting on need a friend here feels like a desperate ,  vain and a hollow effort.
I don’t want to talk to someone and feel like a creep or talk with creeps.
I have lost all the confidence.i was altogether a different person a few months back and now i am back to square one.
With one more disease to deal with.
I don’t know how i did everything nice to myself in the first place i have no idea how i did it , i can’t believe i was so full of life and dedication and motivation and now i don’t know how to be that person."
391,Are you ever accidentally rude?,Anxiety,"Do you ever panic in a social situation and end up being accidentally rude? But then you panic again because you don’t want people to think you’re rude, cause you’re really not, it was just a bad moment?"
392,"Have anxiety, loss of appetite and nausea. Who else has this?",Anxiety,"Hello everyone 

So the past couple days I have been experiencing nausea along with loss of appetite. 
I went to eat at Thanksgiving and when I sat down and was about to eat, I lost my appetite and felt nauseous. It was weird because I ate something prior. 

Two days later I feel better but still have nausea that comes and goes. I am eating plain stuff like oatmeal, apples, and drinking ginger tea. 

I remember having something like this last year around April-May before COVID. I felt off and on nausea for a week or so until it went away. 

I haven’t really been anywhere since COVID is widespread where I live. 

Has anyone ever had this before? I don’t feel particularly anxious but I know anxiety can have crazy side effects."
393,"This is what scares me the most about this continuous lock-down: the imposed restrictions on our freedom, to move &amp; to go wherever we/hug whoever we want. Here's the one and the only reason why I survive (and start to thrive) without any serious panic attack for months.",Anxiety,"Three words: nature, music, and (conscious) relaxation. It sounds logical and too simple to be true. But for me, it does the trick.

What are yours?

Music: I started a new online music training, helping me to read scores, train my ears &amp; improve my piano skills. My brain needs new daily input, and for me, music training does the trick (at least, for a big part). It brings me in the here and now - beyond any meaningless mind-chatter talking me into anxiety &amp; depression. Even when I don't feel like - I commit to do this for at least 10 minutes - often I stay much longer.

Conscious relaxation: every morning &amp; every evening I do some specific breathing exercises, a bit of meditation, and a combination of yoga exercises. The things I practice do change however, the trick for me is to sense what my body needs. Since I'm practicing already +20 years, I have a lot to choose from. 

Nature: I go for daily walks in a nearby park, and I consciously connect with the sounds of the birds and the beauty of the trees. Even when it's raining or whatever: I learn not to judge and just observe. Just doing this helps me to build more resilience, day by day. I never force myself, and whenever I feel I'm making this habit too mechanical, I slow down and take another path, visit another park, look at another tree. This is not about becoming airy-fairy, it's grounding, here &amp; now. 

Oh yes, at home I often (understatement) listen to [these relaxing ocean sounds (this playlist)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4bzeXolqeEd12KrkDeqNng?si=NsYANkZnTJOKTSIkQDFYMw). They help me to calm down my thoughts and bring my awareness to my body and breath."
394,"Progress, at last. Over 6 months of desperation.",Anxiety,"It all started with:

""You're overreacting""
""Can you please calm down?""
""There's nothing wrong with you, all the doctors said so""
""You need to pick yourself up""
""You have a child to raise, get over it""
""How come I can get over it and you can't?""
""You've seen a lot of doctors yet nothing comes up, have you considered that it's actually nothing?"" 
""It's all in your head"" 
""You're not sick, stop acting like it"" 
""Try not to worry"" 


It ends with

""I'm seeing a psychiatrist today"" 
""You have a severe panic disorder"" 
""You're going to be ok"" 
""I've been there, I'm here for you"" 
""You're strong, you got this"" 
""I've booked your therapy session for the 15th, is that ok?"" 
""This will help"" 
""Hey, this thing is helping"" 

""I feel like cooking and cleaning today"" 
""Hey bub dearest, wanna play with mom? Let's play!"" 
""I have been better today"" 
""I'm ok with being alone"" 
""I'm hungry"" 

""I got this"""
395,"Feeling more depressed and anxious while drinking, advice and thoughts please? Crosspost",Anxiety,"Hi everyone, so I wanted to get some thoughts and opinions here. In the past I had no problem having a few drinks on 20mg prozac on the weekends to unwind and chill out, just at home playing videogames, that type of thing. 

I got off 20mg prozac this summer after a year and it was a disaster, so my doctor put me back on 20mg with no titration and of course I dealt with side effects for a month. I'm at six weeks today, and had a few drinks after I got home from the gym and did some chores thinking I'd just chill and play videogames. Instead I'm extremely anxious and depressed, with extremely dark thoughts (not contemplating suicide) but thinking ""oh hey, I wouldn't be too entirely angry if I got hit by a bus next time I'm out"" and that's really really unlike me. (I've had some increased anxiety and depressive thoughts the last few days but nothing like this, but those were sober so???)

I also intermittently take trazodone 100mg for sleep. 

Does anyone have any explanation? I had 7 drinks in the span of 7 hours. I think tomorrow I'm just sticking to water &amp; seltzer water. Just curious why I've been feeling so down lately and especially today? 

Thanks all and stay healthy!"
396,"For those of you who have resigned from your job without another job lined up, how do you cope with the uncertainty &amp; anxiety?",Anxiety,"Background- I'm not quitting my job, but rather, quitting my manager who is extremely toxic, doesn't know how to communicate, micromanages, and threatens corrective action at every turn if she's annoyed.  I can't sleep, I can't shower, my self-esteem is plummeting, and I'm always anxious. I need to resign for my own good, but resigning is ALSO anxiety inducing. I'm going to talk to HR- let them know what's going on- and they can choose to do what they will with the information I give them, I suspect nothing as 96% of complaints against managers at big corps, get thrown out-but I feel obligated to tell them as others suffer under her too but are too scared to say anything.

These times are uncertain, I don't know when I'll get a new job- but I am financially stable. I'm anxious to quit, but I'm also TOO anxious to stay  in a position that is going to undo all the hard work I've done at therapy to control my anxiety."
397,Why do I tests give me panic attacks?,Anxiety,"I’ve always dealt with anxiety and panic/anxiety attacks around medical tests and I don’t know why. I have an issue which requires me to get a blood test every 6 months , I have done this for 4 years and I have a panic attack the night before and maybe the morning EVERY time. More recently my household is talking about getting the new COVID tests, even though we all had it 2 weeks ago (8 people of my 10 person flat tested positive, I didn’t get a test), I was ok with it and went to book an appointment however once I saw it was not the new style and still a swab test my panic set in and I was in tears within 2 mins. Another issue is that when I tell my family I physically can’t go and get a test cause my anxiety is too bad they tell me just to get one which also leads to panic. Does anyone else experience this and do you have any tips?"
398,Need someone to process with? AMA,Anxiety,"Last year I felt like my life was out of control. It seemed like everything I had tried to do to ""fix"" my situation had only added more stress to my life. I could see the whole cycle starting again. I knew that this time I would have to dig in and understand myself in a way that I never had before. I read many great books that gave me the language and the framework to interpret my experiences. I learned breath awareness techniques and began to strengthen my ability to sit with uncomfort without fleeing or fixing it. These techniques and knowledge were amazing, but the biggest help by far came from the care and support of a handful of local teachers in my area.

One group was called Satsang, a hindu tradition that focuses on learning to sit with the physical sensations that come up when we begin to get hijacked by stories. 

The other was a group that met everyday called AWE (Are We Engaging) which emphasized connecting with your authentic self over your preprogrammed self. AWE super accelerated my growth because we were very direct in our self examinations. Other group members could ask you questions and post observations (with consent of course). You were expected to bring your best and possibly answer some difficult questions in areas you might not have looked into in a long time. 

These groups took me in a new direction at a key time in my life and I am very grateful for those experiences. Meds, psychiatrists and pay-by-the-hour counselors are well and great, but there is nothing that can compare to mutual engagement with a real person.   


The surface experience of our lives is a reflection of our actions. All actions are driven by emotion. Emotions are generated by relationships, with ourselves, with others, both consummated and absent.

Every belief that shapes our current world model can be traced back to a specific experience at a specific time with a specific person - in short: a memory. 

It's not so important that we ""fix"" ourselves or change something in the world. Turn the mirror inside out. Once we begin to understand who *we* are and why we do things the exterior world begins to change on it's own.   


&gt;The highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free

399,social anxiety affecting relationship,Anxiety,"so i’ve recently gotten into a long distance relationship which is difficult as is without having social anxiety. my boyfriend and i are both gamers and i’ve recently downloaded one of his favorite games. he’s been very excited to play it with me since he spends most of his time playing with his other friends. i also have been looking forward to playing this particular game with him since i want to show an interest in things he likes.

however the issue lies with my social anxiety. he keeps asking me to join his xbox live with a few of his other friends which scares the hell out of me. even calling him alone can sometimes be a struggle on my part due to my anxiety so the thought of talking to other people i have never met is terrifying. i feel terrible making a promise to him that i’d play when i full know that might not be a promise i can keep which is fault on my part. 

i’ve played online games with other strangers before and so the reaction of other men towards female gamers isn’t the best. a lot of the time they can be toxic towards me which doesn’t help if i’ve never played the game before since they’re likely to call me a ‘fake gamer’ or ‘poser’ and such. 

i know my boyfriend isn’t intentionally pressuring me but i just feel so guilty that i can’t enjoy something together because of my anxiety. any suggestions? i have no idea what to do and just want to make him happy :/"
400,Are meds worth it?,Anxiety,Sure most days I’m a little stressed/anxious but I can manage to work a stressful full time job while going to college.  Albeit I’m only taking one class at the moment.  I just can’t decide if I should start an antidepressant.  I don’t have the money for a therapist but could maybe afford meds.  I’ve tried celexa before but I didn’t get the kind of relief I was expecting.
401,Sudden increase in anxiety with symptoms I’ve never had before,Anxiety,"Hello! I was on Escitalopram (10mg) + Clonazepam 0.5mg for 30 days. On day 30, my doctor took me off Clonazepam and I’ve been on Escitalopram since then. It’s been 10 days since, and my anxiety has worsened to levels I’ve never experienced before. I’m v jumpy, unable to sleep, my hands feel like they’re difficult to control while doing simple things like taking money out of a wallet. Is that an expected side effect? Should I wait, or should I talk to the doctor about this? I go to college tomorrow, and that may be a reason for the sudden spike in my anxiety, but the chest pains are really, really bad and ruining everything.
Edit : I just realised that I’ve been on Clonazepam since August, so it’s been around 4 months of Clonazepam"
402,What's a good Christmas gift for someone with anxiety?,Anxiety,I want to get this person something meaningful and helpful too. Before you ask... there are no apparent hobbies.
403,Home For Holidays and Vomiting,Anxiety,"TW: discussion of vomiting
Due to quarantine and an extended holiday away from college, I’ve been living at home for way longer than I ever have in the past 5 years. My family is very dysfunctional and abusive and causes me an extreme deal of stress (I am diagnosed with GAD and OCD). Starting mid-May, I began to vomit frequently, sometimes two to four times a day. I could barely eat. Once I went back to college and calmed down, this stopped and I could eat whatever I wanted. Now I am home again, and it has started again. I just want to know if anyone else with anxiety has experienced this or has advice. I have seen medical professionals to ensure it is not a legitimate digestive issue and they seem to agree it has to be stress related."
404,Been feeling like i'm aways on the edge,Anxiety,"I think most know this feeling. Being afraid as if your next panick attack is right at the next corner. Or, also pretty bad, feeling like something is wrong, but you just can't tell *what*. Have been like this for the past couple days, and it doesn't seem to be getting better. It sucks."
405,How to deal with fear of missing out anxiety with friends?,Anxiety," Hi all, I recently discovered that I have a really bad tendency to get anxious when I feel as if I'm being left out of stuff, even when I can't make it in the first place. For example, this week I went home for the weekend (I'm in college) for a job interview. While I was home, my friends hung out without me and went out. After hearing about this and seeing it on social media I started to get very anxious to the point that it was uncomfortable and I became pretty upset. Even though I couldn't go with them in the first place, I was sad. This kind of feeling has been getting progressively more common for me over the last year, especially during the quarantine and through starting college. I believe there are a few factors behind it.

First, one of my friends in my friend group and I haven't been getting along very well, even though we used to get along great in high school. This has really thrown me through a loop and he occasionally hangs out with another one of our friends without me. Despite this being their business, not mine, I still get a little upset when I feel like I'm being left out. Second, I think my real fear is that my friends will start intentionally leaving me out of things because they don't want to be around me as much.

I believe this is a case of FOMO. If so, could anyone help me out with ways to feel better when stuff like this happens? I don't want to feel anxious when I have no reason to. Thanks."

408,"I keep having anxiety about death. I think about it sometimes in the day, but always at night. I can't get it off my mind.

410,Have any men successfully conceived while taking zoloft?,Anxiety,"Having a really hard time finding personal experiences on this, seems like all of the research suggests that SSRI’s are terrible for your sperm."
411,Can Panic Attacks cause slurred speech/troubling talking?,Anxiety,I get panic attacks pretty regularly so I know what they usually feel like for me. But today I got a panic attack (i think) and it started out with me kind of seeing stars. I got really hot and it felt like I couldn't see because everything was spotty. Then when I was trying to talk to my mom I started slurring my words and not making sense. I have never had that happen with a panic attack before so I'm wondering if anyone else has had this?? I will say after I started seeing stars I immediatley started to panic so I don't know if the speech was because of that. About an hour after I began feeling weird I began feeling normal again so I am almost sure it was a panic attack but it was wild.
412,Seperation Anxiety,Anxiety,I am pretty sure I suffer from Seperation Anxiety Disorder as part of my PTSD because I was neglected so now I hate being alone and it makes me really really anxious. Does anyone else have any experience with this and/or suggestions about how to deal with it?
413,Is it Anxiety or something else,Anxiety,"Hey guys!

I am super new here and asking for a help. I would be so grateful for whoever can answer my questions. 

Here’s my story: for around 4 years Ive been having mainly huge abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation. I’ve done tons of tests and endo/colonoscopy but had nothing diagnosed. Also have done a couple of things (stopping alcohol + reducing sugar) but nothing made it gone (better but not that much). I’ve always been a stressed person and always having health problems, but in the last couple of years it’s unbearable. 
Alongside my GI problems, i can’t seem to relax. My sleep is very bad, problems breathing, random headaches, very sensitive and bad memory and a very weird thing is happing to me: whenever I hear anything i get afraid and my belly stresses out. Also when my GF touches me (without knowing) my abdominal stresses out. 
There’s a ton of other things, but my questions are the following:

1) Is that anxiety 😫? Could my whole GI problems be causes by anxiety and only anxiety ? Tbh i truly don’t know whats anxiety at the first place and how it feels 😞. 

2) what would you recommend if you were in my case ? I am 27 years old btw

3) do you think my gut is causing me my anxiety or the anxiety is making my gut upset all the time. 

Thank you so much! I would really appreciate an answer. ❤️❤️"
414,I feel too *aware*?,Anxiety,"My anxiety has gained a new friend! Being too aware of what is happening, I literally think about how life it meaningless every day multiple times a day. I will get scared and so sad randomly after thinking about how anyone and everyone I know will die and when I die then what? Nothingness? I don't want to live a-whole life to end up just dead. No more thoughts? No more people? Nothing at all? Scares the shit out of me and makes me have anxiety attacks wondering what life even is.... Anyone else? 

I've told people around me i think like this but they tell me to forget about it as if its that easy to just forget how life means nothing in the end!!!!

Just wanted to share and see if anyone else feels like this? (Not sure if discussion was the right flare..lol.)"
415,Any tips?,Anxiety,"I've been having anxiety when I drink water, I can't breathe while drinking and it f@#ks with my head, I also have been feeling like I'm suffocating from wearing clothing. I wanna die. Someone help me! My doc prescribed clonazepam .5mg as needed once a day for 7 days, I'm hesitant to take it because I want to learn to deal with my anxiety without drugs, please help!"
417,Suddenly becoming anxious about small things,Anxiety,"So right now it is the middle of the night. I am sitting in my room, and my pajamas are folded next to me. I need to take a shower, but for some reason the thought of doing so has been making me super freaked out. I have been sitting here procrastinating for hours. It sounds stupid, but its like im scared to walk down the hall and take a shower, and its only worse now its the middle of the night. 

I have never experienced this over showering before. My fear comes from the fact that I live in a country where sometimes the electricity cuts out for a while unexpectedly. Over the years, since childhood, this has happened many times when I have been in the shower. Sitting on the floor of the shower in the total dark, screaming for someone to help me because I wasn't expecting the light to go out and I couldn't get out without slipping or falling in the dark. 

I just need someone to talk me through it I guess. I'm still sitting here now. Its a simple thing but can someone just give me like a lost of what I should do when I go take a shower. I know the lights will stay on but I still feel anxious about them going off."
418,Got yelled at by my parents for having music too loud and I feel so ashamed,Anxiety,"Was playing Beat Saber, am new to the game. Didn’t realize how loud my music was and my parents got mad at me. I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself and I feel like I want to cry."
419,I’m having major heart anxiety right now. Help!,Anxiety,"Hey y’all. Today I’ve been having really bad heart anxiety. I’ve been getting these sharp pains all over my body like my legs feet arms and hands but they always go away and then come back, but I feel like I should add that they aren’t extremely painful, just noticeable painful, if that makes sense. Anyway, I went to the doctor and she said it’s completely normal and that it was just something that involves my nerves. Two years ago I panicked about my heart and felt like I couldn’t breathe right, and that I was literally floating, so I went and got TWO ekg’s which both came back clear, so this whole heart anxiety really isn’t new to me. Yet, I’m still freaking out about it. I’m convinced I’m gonna eat the wrong food or bend a certain way and my heart is just going to fail on me. This constant worrying has made my chest start to feel tighter, which does not help at all. Does anyone who goes through heart anxiety have any advice/support to help? I would so appreciate it!"
420,Unable To Work,Anxiety,"For years I haven’t been able to work because of depression and anxiety issues. I would get a job, work for a few months or close to a year then I would quit. It’s been like that since I was 19. I’m 24 and I live with my fiancé in our own apartment. She works full time and has considered getting a second part time job cause of some money issues. We can pay the bills but we aren’t left with much after that. I just feel awful it might have to resort to working even more than she already does because I have a fear of working because of my anxiety. It’s really starting to get to me more and effect my depression because I don’t feel good enough to help her out the way she needs. She always reassured me that it’s okay and that it’s not my fault, but I still always feels like it is. I’m not lazy, I’m a very hard worker when I do work. It’s been about a year since my last job and I loved that job more than any other I had. I loved the people, I liked the work and all of my coworkers and boss’ loved me. I earned a position promotion only 4 months into the job and took it. After that I loved it even more. I felt so good that I was doing a good job at work because I never really did in the past. Well one day I just couldn’t do it anymore, even tho I liked the job, so I quit. I noticed my anxiety and depression were slowly starting to come back in a few weeks before I quit because when I started work it really helped those two aspects. Then one day without even thinking I quit and it all got worse. It’s been a year since then and I always regret it and I don’t understand why I have to be this way. One of the hardest things about this is being around so many people who are extremely hard works and do so good in their jobs. Both parents, all my brothers and sisters, friends and my fiancé are all some of the best workers there are. And then theres me. I just can’t stand living this way and feeling scared to do something that so many people I know do and love. I’m getting married in a little over a year and I can’t imagine not working and providing for my wife and our future children. I could really use some advice from anyone who has experienced this same problem, and if you have how did you overcome it? Thank you."

does anyone have any advice for how to overcome something like this based on real experience? I'm so lost right now"
423,I'm becoming an irrational girlfriend.,Anxiety,"Hi everyone.  Apologizes in advance for mobile formatting. 

This is a throw away account but I'm in desperate need of help. 

I have a boyfriend.  We've been together for almost 2 years, we've known each other for 3. We are currently in a long distance relationship, and until now, we've been good at it. We wont be together in person until Feburary.  

Recently, my anxiety has been out of control (I've been diagnosed with depression and a panic disorder since I was 16 and I'm currently 35). I've never had a lot of anxiety when it comes to him. I know that he loves me. But now my anxiety is making me an irrational girlfriend.  

For example, the new World of Warcraft expansion recently came out.  Due to a misunderstanding, he has devoted all his gaming time to other friends, instead of to the characters we've always played together. And we've been playing WoW together since shortly after we discovered it was a mutual interest.  I view that game as ""our thing"" and I feel like I've lost that now. 

The super fucked up thing is that now every time he plays that game, I get irrationally mad and super anxious. He's offered to tell his other friends that he can't play with them, but I feel that's stupid and I've encouraged him not to do that.  It's just a game and he should be able to play it how he wants to, and not have me freak out over it. To compound all of this, he recently got a job, so our time together is already dwindling, as now we have to work around our work schedules. 

I know it would be better if we weren't long distance. But I feel like, right now, all we have is our time together when we're in Discord or playing a game together.  

I plan to restart therapy in January (I dont have benefits until then because I had to wait for open enrollment), but I need help in the meantime. 

This relationship anxiety is spilling into every other facet of my life. It's raised my general anxiety and I can't eat at all, nor am I sleeping well. I'm basically obsessing over this. 

I feel ridiculous over being anxious about a video game. I know it's irrational and silly, but as many of you know, we can't choose what our anxiety goes crazy over. 

And wisdom or support would be insanely appreciated."
424,Just venting on my Covid anxiety,Anxiety,"TL;DR: fam I saw on thanksgiving had fever and headache day after and now two days after I’m having shortness of breath despite having no other symptoms 


Went to fams for thanksgiving only six of us. one then woke up the next day with fever and headache. So now we’re all in self isolation as we’re waiting for his and his wife’s tested (we’re getting Monday). Had a big bout of shortness of breath for a good hour or so (still getting over it) despite having no fever or cough. I know have an anxiety as this isn’t the first however it’s a lot different now that you know that you may have been in contact with someone whose had. His wife said she’s doing fine and he said the fever is gone but headache and fatigue"
425,Anyone been inside since February?,Anxiety,"TW agoraphobia, ED, mentions of COVID


I’m 20, high risk, and my mom is high risk too (I live with her). I haven’t been out since February aside from doctors appointments because of COVID. Groceries bought online and picked up contactless. Haven’t seen friends, family, anyone aside from my mom. I snuck out, as a 20 year old, to see a friend about once a week for a month in July. That ended. 

Put off medically necessary things just because of the risk and her swearing that I’ll kill her if I go out and having to be sanitized every time I go to a dr. I can’t handle moving out because of finances and if I try to go get a job she’ll kick me out for exposing her to people I’ve been exposed to. 

Driving around keeps me sane but my anxiety is so bad now that I won’t drive more than 20 mins out. I fear hanging out with anyone again. 

I’m an ex agoraphobe and fear I’m one again. Mentally I’m not ok anymore. I break down more frequently than ever. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? I just wish things could go back to the way they were. I can’t hold out much longer. I’ve relapsed with GAD, OCD, ED, and probably agoraphobia if I tried going out of my comfort zone."
426,Chest pain anxiety,Anxiety,"Hey! I get this dull pain/pressure on the left side of my chest and left arm when i'm anxious. and sometimes it comes back even when i think i am not anxious. 
Has anyone had this problem? If so, how to cope? :("
427,Do I have an anxiety disorder?,Anxiety,"I'm in my 20s. I get nervous very easily; I start feeling unnaturally cold. My stomach hurts a lot, and I experience a shortness of breath. Somtimes my leg starts shaking by itself. I feel like crying. Is this normal?"
428,"Crying, yes or no?",Anxiety,"Sometimes I feel like crying from the anxious feelings, but I generally manage to brush the feeling off. It helps me to feel in control, which is nice, but sometimes I wonder if it might be cathartic to cry and get some of the excess stress hormones out.

If I ""let it out"" occasionally will that set me back control-wise, or will it give me a bit of a reprieve and leave me better able to handle the anxiety for the rest of the day?"
430,What should I expect from risperdal withdrawal?,Anxiety,"I've been on risperdal for over 6 years for depression and anxiety. Currently I take Zoloft 100mg, and mirtazapine 15 sometimes, and risperdal 2mg. I've also been taking large amounts of THC through vaping concentrates

Recently with guidance from my psychiatrist I've been slowly getting off risperdal.

I was down to 1mg and a half but I just ran out. And my pharmacy doesn't have 1mg.

Anyways, I've been without risperdal for maybe 4 days.

I don't know, but I feel like I'm high but not a good high.

I feel kind of funky. As if like, a sense of doom or something. I''ve also been running every week.

I don't know, I just feel kind of weird. A sense of uneasy.

I just really want to stop taking this drug. What if I just stop? I'm sick of the weight gain from risperdal. What if I just stop?

You can't die from risperdal withdrawal. Will I start to feel better soon?

I've been depressed my whole life and just wanted to try something new. Maybe risperdal is making me sad?

I just feel uncomfortable right now...like a sense of unease...

What was your experience getting off risperdal?"
431,"What tips, techniques or strategies have been game changers for you ?",Anxiety,"For me , acceptance and floating have changed everything"
432,Freaked myself out,Anxiety,"Has anyone else made the mistake of going onto the covid subs (hoping to find positive stories) and completely freaking yourself out because so many people seem to suffer with n*, d* and v*?!"
433,I'm uncertain in my movement,Anxiety,"First off, hello, and secondly I am sorry for not being sure on how to address this being relatively new to the subreddit (and well a lurker to reddit as whole).  
I'm a 17 year old who generally lives what seems to be a health life. But with covid I have had lots of time to think, and I mean truly think, unbiasly (if that's even a word lol) about the different outlooks on the world. I am not diagnosed with any sort of anxiety or sort. But I found myself the past few months regularly not being able to sleep but little to two or three hours a night. Where as the two years before 4-5 hours. I see the world around me in a odd tense with this time that I've had so understanding this feeling makes me feel I have actually neglected it for a while. I actually have contemplated losing worth in it too. I abnormally feel myself shiver in fear of just the mear thought of worth. I guess its an existential crisis to word it? I really don't feel comfortable telling these thoughts to my parents and I genuinely dont feel close enough to any friends to bring it up with either. Sadly with my current situation it also is near impossible to meet new people outside of the internet. So my main uncertainty is this, is there a place I could go to better express these thoughts (discretely) and hopefully relief this fear? I've tried googling for things that sound similar to what I've expressed but most studies narrow it too much to seem reasonable and I feel as though already what I've typed is a bit long for a post. Literally any sort of website, discord, other therapy chat would be useful."
434,Any advice on how to not be anxious while living alone for the first time?,Anxiety,"I [22M] am going to move out for the first time in a few months. I think I should mention I’m special needs, the main issue is my autism. I’ve spent 4 years learning how to do basic stuff like laundry and cooking which for most people is no problem. I need to be told several times and shown to even get it. I am getting a service dog for my anxiety on my birthday in March, however I’m moving around January/February. I get panic attacks every week and I’m not sure how to cope on my own until I can get my new pupper. Does anyone have good advice?"
435,It’s hard cutting out your friends.,Anxiety,"It’s incredibly hard. I thought it was going to be easy. My friends, made fun of my anxiety and depression, essentially making me the butt of their jokes. That’s why I cut them out. They came at me thinking that they were right and I was just being too emotional. Idk about that but I left it at that. Now can you just imagine all your former friends going to a birthday party along with your current ones? It fucking sucks. Not being invited, it makes me feel like I should not have cut them out. Now it just feels like i’m sulking because I wasn’t invited, either that or i’m just a very anxious 17 year old :’) That’s it. That’s why really mundane story to most but thank you to those reading"
436,does anyone else start freaking out when they are out of dissociative state and in their bodies?,Anxiety,and thats what causes anxiety? actually feeling anything bc were so used to joking about it and not trusting our own emotions bv of trauma?
437,"Not sure whether i have a ‘bad gut feeling’ because of anxiety or gerd, and at this point im too afraid to ask ( or seek professional help)",Anxiety,"Hope you all are coping well :)

Lately i have lost my appetite, and the gerd comes the worst of it. Most times i feel nauseous. This week has been the worst bcs I get frequent headaches and shallow breaths. It feels even worst bcs this week is actually my leisure week when i have no deadlines, i could and should have been just chilling. But idk why my body feels like i have to cope with something.

When i got a slight inconvenience, i started to feel pounding in my head, and then i started to notice that every time i take a breath, it never felt like my lung is fulfilled. I have experienced this a little while ago when i lost my father. My family and i know nothing about anxiety back then (or even now), and it got so bad that everytime im breathing, my chest hurt. so i just asked to be checked by a general doctor and she said there’s nothing wrong with me, and it made me feel like a delusional weirdo.

I tried to be active and exercise to overcome this. I felt better for several hours, but then the headache always coming back. This has always happened everytime i have a high intensity training. My sister suggest to take b complex vitamin and today i bought it! Hopefully it will help.

I also not sure whether this has something to do with caffeine. The other day i tried to cut it off, but somehow the headache and breathing problem is still there. Maybe im not cutting it off long enough? But it’s hard when im doing online classes, and idk if it’s bcs im lazy or what, but most times i feel sleepy and need caffeine to kickstart my day. I guess i have a love and hate relationship with coffee, and today i had a big one, i just hope i can go to sleep.

I am trying my best to be happy and content with my life. In fact, i felt happy today bcs i spent a quality time with my family, but the inconvenient feeling of anxiety is always there. It makes me sad bcs it’s hard to be in the moment when as simple as breathing feels like an effort.

Based on past experience, i know ill get through this and things will get better. Im just hoping i can go to sleep now.

For those of you who are in the same boat, i also hope we all can get through this, better days are coming💖"
438,Long term shortness of breath with no cause,Anxiety,"Hi wondering if anyone has experienced similar or has an idea of what I’m going through, for the last 9 months I have had problems with my breathing, mainly not being able to take a deep breath and fill my lungs. 24 year old male who is fit regularly runs and goes to gym. I just woke up one morning and it was there i couldn't fill my lungs and its just never went away. Tried inhalers,anti histamines, chest xray and even had a trip to accident and emergency to get checked over. It was causing panic attacks but that wasn't what was worrying me it was the constant being short of breathe even when i felt relaxed, it was worse at night and disrupted sleeping. It’s difficult to explain but i am not out of breath or puffing and panting etc but I am just not able to catch my breath to begin with. Exercise has become uncomfortable and just frustrating. I’m constantly yawning to try get the satisfaction of taking a deep breath. TIA"
439,can anyone in the UK recommend a private psychiatrist who can give a diagnosis?,Anxiety,Doesn't matter where abouts in the UK as everything will be telephone/video call now. Looking for a diagnosis and obvs NHS is useless with that so thinking of going private. Cheaper options are preferable although obvs it's all kinda expensive... thanks!
440,Swallowing anxiety?,Anxiety,"DAE experience swallowing anxiety with food and pills? 

This is my first time posting, but just wondering if anyone else experiences this. I’m not sure if this would be the correct thread or if the GERD one would be better. I’m really sorry if this sounds rambly, doesn’t make sense, or if this is the wrong place for it. It is something that’s driving me up the wall and making me feel a bit defeated at the moment. 

I have recently began seeing a psych for my troubles with anxiety/depression and  I am in the process of investigating my mental health overall (many years of symptoms, with no intervention until recently, so I have a scroll of traumatic events to work through). I was also recently diagnosed with GERD/acid reflux after suffering from a chronic cough for years.

I’ve seen connections made between the anxiety and GERD, but at this rate I feel like it is just my anxiety. I am waiting for an endoscopy to make sure nothing is physiologically wrong, but I am physically able to swallow.

When eating or taking pills, it’s like my brain and tongue block ANYTHING from going down my throat because it feels like I’m choking even before I swallow. I work myself into a state of panic (clammy hands, racing heart, throat constriction, dizziness, thoughts of choking and dying, etc.). Pills have been the most difficult, but it is becoming this way with food too. I also had teeth removed recently and have been struggling to swallow even soft or liquid things, like applesauce or soup, because of my fear. I sit with it in my mouth, but end up spitting it out or swallowing and feeling immediate anxiety This is hard because I can’t swallow the painkillers or antibiotics received after my extraction, so I empty the capsules onto applesauce (per my pharmacist) and try to consume them like that, but still can’t.

Has anyone else experienced food/swallowing anxiety like this?"
441,Sounds that help to calm down again,Anxiety,"Does anybody want to share some sounds or something they like listening to to calm down?
I myself like (I know might be weird) to listen to submarine sounds. Sonar, water bubbles, ship screw cavitation..."
442,Who else feels this way?,Anxiety,"So I know there’s lots of different types of anxiety and we can all experience it in a different way. I spoke to my therapist (2nd session) and she was the first person to articulate the feeling I get. She scrunched/hunched her body inwards and said it feels like there is a big black block in your stomach. This is what my anxiety feels like. She also gave me advice that I tried for the first time today and it worked. I told her I normally wake up and that’s when I’ll know if I’m going to have an anxiety day or not. She said the next time you wake up with anxiety, don’t think that’s you stuck with it for the day, say to yourself, okay maybe this will just be a morning of anxiety and we’ll see what we’re like in the afternoon. It worked for me today. I woke up feeling amazing and then thud, the black block arrived. Now I would normally think that’s my day ruined. But I accepted my anxiety, I told my partner and my daughter how I was feeling and that I was trying to come out of it. So I went for a shower, got ready, still felt a bit off but a bit better and then whoosh. Gone. 

I just thought I’d share this incase it could help anyone else that feels that big black block. Or maybe you have your own name for it? Thanks to anyone who read this. This is my favourite sub because I feel like you can share anything without fear of judgement. 💜"
443,I feel like Everything makes me anxious these days,Anxiety,"Just for a very short background, I'm an immigrant from Venezuela, green card holder and waiting to renew it. 

However it feels like ever since coming to the US, my anxiety has flared up for absolutely no reason. I wake up, I feel anxious about whether the dishes got done the night before or if I will find any new ones, I shower and I get anxious about taking too long in there and being late, I feel anxious about making breakfast to the point of not eating any and then buying food for lunch (which is making a hole in my pocket), when I'm at work, I'm anxious about my boss feeling down because of everything that's happening (This makes sense at least, I actually want to help the guy, he's been a great friend), when I get home, I get anxious about interacting with my brother in law and my wife (although I feel fine interacting with them individually), I feel anxious about the phone ringing, the mail coming in,  the idea of being denied immigration benefits even though my wife and I did everything right, and have no criminal record or wrongful information whatsoever. I feel nervous about going to bed too early, can't waste the evening. Or too late, can't wake up drowsy. If I play games, I feel I should be studying to stay in the loop with new technologies, and if I study, I feel like I should be relaxing.

I can't do anything guys! I went to therapy for a while, but I couldn't afford to keep going.  

Do you guys think all of this anxiety is due to immigration related stress and maybe PTSD from living in that hell of a country for so long? It feels entirely irrational. I'm jumping at shadows here."
444,Relationship anxiety all got a bit too much today,Anxiety,"It's my first serious relationship and I thought anxiety would not appear but alas it did. Everything is great. He's smart, warm and so caring. We have healthy communication and our goals are aligned. But I keep getting so worried. Worried that I might not like him, worried that he's not right for me. Worried at every random thing he does. I don't like this at all, I want to quell these thoughts but today it all got a bit much. The thoughts keep going. I can't stay focused. I love and care for him.

I think I need a hug and some sleep. Has anyone had similar experiences and how do you cope?"
446,Awful Haircut,Anxiety,"I’m literally having a panic attack rn over my hair. My sister cut it for me but she cut it really short without asking me. It’s awful. Like so bad. I’m not even being dramatic right now it looks terrible. I don’t know how I’m meant to go to school on Monday like this, i wish I was anyone else. I’m thinking of literally making myself sick to avoid it because I can’t go out like this. My other siblings have been laughing at me the whole time too. I don’t know what to do."
447,Venting,Anxiety,"If you can offer advice, please please do

I am a teenager and am currently doing online school. For the last 3 weeks my anxiety has spiked up really bad. I have always had the whole thing, OCD, Social anxiety and just plain anxiety all wrapped in a package but it's never hit me like it has recently. My paranoia has been out of control, I feel like I'm dying and having a panic attack all the time. 

I wake up having a panic attack in the middle of the night or when I'm in that middle of sleep and wake. I wake up gasping for air like you would after a nightmare and my days are just as bad with the feeling of someone sitting on my stomach and that causes my throat to feel tight. My OCD makes repeatably wash my hands, in the past this was until they bleed but I'm trying to hold back. Right now I honestly want to have a mental breakdown every day, I can't sleep, I can't eat. And I know it's all in my head because I have these moments of clarity but I feel like I'm going insane. People keep telling me that I need to figure out what's causing the anxiety but for the love of God I dont know. All I know is that I'm miserable. For two days I found that taking night quil at night makes me eventually fall asleep, so I've been getting at least a few hours depending on the day, and sometimes I have to watch videos to distract me from trying to breath so I can eat. 

I can tell everyone in my house thinks I'm crazy. I've told them something was wrong with me and I needed to see a doctor. (I have prescribed anxiety meds) but the ones I have aren't working and my paranoia keeps telling me it's something more. There have been days when I doubted whether or not I was going to wake up. Not because I harmed myself but because my brain told me that is how sick I was. And I know that I'm stressing my mom and that she does care, but when she keeps asking me if im taking my medicine or has my step dad go secretly check to make sure, I feel so sad. Like don't you think I'm doing everything I can to make this awful feeling go away? And she will tell me to tell her about my anxiety but the truth is I shouldn't unless I have a therapist appointment because then she fusses because shes too worried about me to function but if I dont tell her the same thing applies. It's not her fault but I wish she realised that if I could just stop I would. I don't blame her for seeing me and saying for me to just stop but I wish I could!! I'm taking my meds, so it's better than if I wasn't but I'm still barely coping. I've been looking up online things to deal with anxiety but those have short term effects and don't help my panic attacks. I feel like it's all my fault and I know that it is, but I wish I could make the part in me doing it to stop. Half the time I'm hearing myself and I know I sound crazy but I need someone to tell me I'm crazy rn, but at the same time I need someone to believe me. Because although I know these things are inside my head they all feel so real. Its always been real but never this real.Sometimes I convince myself that I'm faking it, that I'm just doing it all just too do it, I know this also isn't true but sometimes I want it to be. I honestly don't know what I should do. I have a couple more days until my next appointment and I'm just surviving until then. Thanks for listening, if you have any advice please share. Thankyou."

I have bad anxiety and struggle sparking conversation with new people. My parents suggested I get a “fun job” to meet new people around my age that are also in school. I’m not against the idea, I’m just afraid if I start working a new job with people I’ll continue to bubble myself and not talk as usual or come across as awkward, and in result making the job miserable for me. I just want to be able to actually talk, meet friends, and get where I know I should be. I fear that if my anxiety continues and I don’t do anything soon to change it I’ll end up r/foreveralone without friends/SO. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you for reading!"
454,NSFW Boys/men I need your help because I’m freaking out,Anxiety,"For the last few days my right testicle has felt irritated and it hasn’t got better or worse. The pain isn’t bad, just annoying. I was in the shower and felt around where the feeling was at and I thought I felt a lump. I got out of the shower and felt around again and couldn’t find anything. Not only that but when I am feeling around for stuff I convince myself I’ve found 10 different lumps on each testicle. So my question is how do you check yourself for lumps without anxiety getting to you? I can’t seem to do it without freaking myself out. Do you 100% know there’s something there and don’t just wonder? And can you easily find it again if there is something? I’m worried there is something I just can’t find it. But I wanna make sure there’s something there before going to the doctors. So I really don’t know what to do"

I was doing really good about month later, it was unbelievable feeling that I finally made it. I felt so strong. But last few weeks it's getting worse. It's certainly not that bad. But I am really emotional and feel weak. I don't really know why. It's pissing me off and I'm doubting about myself if I can really make it for longer period.

460,A Person in Progress,Anxiety,"Disclaimer: This is not a essay on whether women or men are more at fault for the detachments that occur between them. Rather it is a summary of on person’s struggle and journey towards finding what can be used to bring them together. Obviously it may be repetitive and annoying, but hopefully it can resonate with people who feel like they are alone in this world and just watch the people with the apparent confidence to share their life enjoy what they cannot.

One element of advice from a man who received more attention than he deserved from women to the anyone who decides to listen: Initiate Conversation with those you subconsciously believe as less than you. This will take practice and experience to learn, but normally if you find something uninteresting or boring, you have a prime opportunity in life to learn and grow for yourself and something else. Please take it.

Whether or not it will serve me well to do this, I am in a state of constant argument with my own mind, morals, and morality. I could choose to walk away from these feelings and accept that the journey to overcome this would be unlikely to succeed. It is why I am writing. As most great adventures go, history will ignore the millions that died while trying. Or as Yoda says, those that do not, are ignored.

At some point in growing up in grade school I started to have overwhelming anxiety that was akin to having a flu’s nausea whenever I missed an assignment. It would be a minimal reading assignment at first or just a missed practice, but would evolve to not showing up for presentations of group projects. Prior to having the internet, a child’s mind had books and old movies to play out and reflect their imaginations. How it was passed to me, I cannot say as I have no recollection of any mention of sex while growing up, but at some point the concept of sex grew out of these mediums. By about 2/3 grade I had somehow discovered what sex was and was given detention by making fun of a girl at school about her wanting to have sex along with another kid. 

Natural bodily functions were functional, necessary, but a bane to existence, I would have issues that had been recurring since I was young. One of my first recollections is having been unable to control myself in the main area of the house and trying to clean shit up myself at around 5 years old. After that, I know I had trouble controlling myself while sleeping. I would either have night terrors and sleep walk, wake up screaming, or else wake up having peed, shit, or vomitted on myself. Well into my elementary school years, my my mother kept a walkie talkie in my room and once caused her to break a toe trying to stop me from doing one of those acts in the middle of the night and went to the hospital. Gloriously these reactions happened at restaurants, but my memory is hazier there. Nightmares where I would recall being at a family meal and not being able to interact with people and becoming very concerned that I would never be able to communicate with anyone. At times this manifested by being at school with a fever and convincing my teachers that any feverish symptoms were due to playing outside.

So welcome to the show. You’ve got the hook. It’s terribly baited. What sexual being would choose something destined to be ignored, pitied, and rejected. One that is logical.

A word of note, the majority of those memories are of a selfish being. A being so mentally incapable of understanding of the outside world that my family’s burden maintaining that kind of child is rarely considered in my head. I was even fascinated by a TV show where a woman was demonstrating methods the mafia used to kill people which stuck in my mind. She would not die, but my thoughts would begin to wonder how to solve those frustrating childish problems.

******
First section isn’t really abuse as the term is commonly understood. While I do believe that physical and sexual abuse are way worse, the action to accept that I was helps me see that others are too and to not act out in reaction if they act in a negative way to me. Mind you it’s taken me 28 years to see this with countless male friends, but admittedly few or one directional female friends spending time with me. This may be identified earlier if the friendships at a younger age are stronger, long lasting, and deeply emotional. In my circumstance it was not.

To not make this a self hating essay, I have to give credit that I made my own friendships for the most part. The concept of parents molding a child’s social circle was ambiguous to me, as mostly is the case for all abusive households. If the parent is struggling there is a good chance that struggle will be passed on to the kid. For the most part I was able to create a world to be successful in. But taking a small sliver of wisdom from Thomas Jefferson (given his own failings at following his own advice): continuously refresh that world. He believed a constitution should be rewritten every 20 years, and a person has much more freedom of movement to accomplish that much more regularly.

******
Avoidance that resulted in long term thoughts and pain started in 4th grade. A girl made it clear she was interested in me during a school game and for now all I recall is that I froze up and could not respond to her. A friend pulled me aside to offer a child’s advice, but it didn’t help. Given I had had other instances of severe anxiety induced by a fear of missing out, it’s not surprising it stuck. But it is blatant how often that repeated itself. People would try to socialize with me on bus rides and I would have none of it. When my guy friends would be attempting to flirt with girls I would make a fool of myself and ruin the sense of secrecy that they were trying to convey. In addition, I would be too friendly around my friends girlfriends. Developing inside jokes about my friends with the girls. Both instances made me an outsider in most intimacy discussions at that stage.

You get the point. Awkward, painfully shy, obnoxiously self centered and not willing to play by the rules, ignoring the fact that the rules were unknown. So to spice that ignorance up: I started to look at photos of naked women on workplace supplied computers where my mother taught. Obviously as any kid would, I had found other mechanisms using catalogs and yearbooks, but that was my first excursion into acting a way that could harm others. I was a loner and loser so making use of my sisters old barbies and dressed them up in “revealing” versions of their clothing to replicate the images I found online when I couldn’t be online was not irrational at the time. Of course I then used my small savings to purchase a PSP knowing it had internet capabilities and from them on only used my mother’s laptop when I needed escalation. Around this time I developed fantasies in my head of dying and the people at school being sad for that happening.

Escalation is the natural entropy of a young guy and trading sleep for more sexual release was a natural tradeoff in my life. I did learn some interesting skills around this time with respect to learning how to down videos and photos and spent hours solving problems that were not even solvable at the time. I was able to skate by school with lucky amount of intelligence and memory that worked in my favor to passing classes that I spent no time on understanding. I would always wait until I was completely satiated to start work, and working by flashlight. This time was heavy with categorizing photos in various structures which was a weird hobby I also had growing up with toys. I inevitably evolved into reading erotic text stories that I found and would spend hours reading trading in my previous passion for reading in general. A concern with the written language that I didn’t realize then, but the imagination with words can be much more elaborate and subversive in daily situations for me. I would catch myself daydreaming at school about the written stories, while I previously had only thought of the photos I had seen online.

Avoiding social situations began at this time. I would go to family reunions or hang out with friends and be distinctly bored by the whole interaction. Wanting to go and do what I would normally do alone and not be able to do so. I would dehydrate myself and choose fantasy over engaging with friends while on trips with them. It started my habit of masturbating in the company of others, but attempting to do so without being noticed became a recurring hobby through college. An inability to have close friendships developed and I would move into different circles in school, with struggles, to begin associating with “smarter” children. This led to a detachment from previous friendships and an evolution to becoming someone who held birthday parties people would rarely attend and at one time, only 1 person did so. My habit of avoiding social situations began by avoiding the 8th grade dance. A girl did comment on it, but I let it just leave my mind as a lie at the time. I then attended a an 8th grade graduation, but shit my pants and stayed at the party while trying to clean up intermittently. I am very confident that I did not pull that off and I never really saw those people again.

Over the next couple years, I would do poorly on class work that required effort rather than just smarts and I started the process of no longer practicing musical instruments. My trumpet was first as I felt that I would impede my TV time and my parents would not appreciate me playing it when they got home. This was also the time my sister and I started to interact as my parents: we would have huge fights and then go watch TV in separate rooms all day. I also started to develop performance anxiety and could never play solos in front of large crowds.

Up until this point, I had been stealing all of my internet connection from our neighbors growing up. But around middle of high school we ended up getting internet. I used some past research to download tools and convert videos and images into more portable formats and continued to expand the amount of photos and videos I saw. I would also start reading not just violent, but kidnap and torture focused stories as well as full on death/murder and found stories with women of questionable ages along with beginning to fund a lot of fascination with Dexter and Criminal Minds.

******
High school gave me more opportunities to both engage socially and then avoid social interaction. Numerous people would try to talk to me, but feeling myself a mixture of unworthy and unlike them inspired a lack of work towards becoming social. High school girls gave me the nickname “failure” at some point due to my performance anxiety. While I went to one homecoming, I avoided the rest and only socialized during school sponsored activities and a few times hung out with friends. A girl talked to me on the bus and I just ranted about something until she no longer wished to talk to me. She also reached out to me at one point and asked if I believed a human brain could think itself into a sickness. To which I chose not to respond besides stating that if it was true, then the opposite had to be also true. Women would openly express a desire to be friends and spend time with me, and I would either pretend not to notice or shut it down if I did not like them sexually.

One person had the determination to make something happen with me instead of just hanging out as part of a friend group. She directly asked me why I hugged another girl and not her and started to hug me. I would respond with asking her to hang out while we avoided doing work in band and even hugging her in front of other people when she “accidentally” put herself close to me. She then put her shaved legs on mine on a bus ride and also cuddled on another. Both times I either was too concerned with stomach issues causing me to relive the anxiety of childhood stomach issues. She helped escalate our interactions, but the anxiety and jealousy of her other male friends and other facts of her social abilities ultimately led me to finding yet more solace in porn as I ran away from her. 

This was not an isolated incident in my fantasies/memories. One girl “accidentally” sat on my arm which was resting on the table while she read something on a wall. I could have asked her to move or shift or say something and instead I just sat still and acted indifferent. Someone even called me out while playing poker (at which I easily lost) and told me that I only played with a good hand. Another time I did the same thing I did in 4th grade and avoided attempting to spend time with someone in fear that she would cut my balls off and I stuck to that viewpoint given many opportunities to modify my actions 

I would decide to double down on written stories about women of uncertain age involved in asphyxia scenarios, torture and electric shock scenarios, as well as death. I would not find this much of an opportunity to change myself until college, and instead I existed in a state of boredom and uncertainty. Unsure of what I was feeling and unwilling to feel it. I did have a reputation for going to friends houses to play video games and playing cheaply without building up any other skills. Admittedly I did not spend time practicing so they had validity to that statement. At the end of high school the only time I took to drink was with my mother when she allowed me to share a sherry my sister had actually received for her graduation. Even then though, I would drink to get drunk. I explicitly recall my mother having to tell me to stop and not keep drinking.

******
Social anxiety and alcohol at college gave me the opportunity to act with freedom from my past isolation. But the missed opportunities kept occurring. On targeted me within a group of random people I helped coordinate and I went after her, a first time for me. We hung out, but when I decided to act on it, she would push back often and didn’t seem to notice that she did get me off, and then did again but made it clear it was not something she enjoyed. Ended up ghosting her just because I couldn’t stay interested in her physically or mentally. Danced with others at a party, but could only do so when blacked out. Otherwise I would never talk to anyone and would only be creepy, by trying to dance with people without talking and touching them without asking.

During this time, my drinking escalated to the point where I worked during the week to drink. In addition, I would take any opportunity on offer to smoke and drink any day of the week and took pride in surviving as well as I did while doing so. Though my grades did begin to drop, my weekly blackouts were not seen by me to be a major concern. I would take liberties in vomiting and forcing people to take care of me on regular occasions following significant binges. Once locking myself out of my dorm, and even more often requiring a clean up process the next day.

This did modify as I went into my second year in college. I would explicitly try to avoid socializing as often, but another issue started where I would begin to budget my efforts and binge more dramatically and had to be taken care of by my new roommates that were not my friends. A key instance was when I was drinking with people after a tough week and while I walked myself home (which I did so often in blackout situations) I ended up waking up a block from my dorm with paramedics taking care of me. I managed to talk them into letting me go home, but this was my first instance of losing all logic after drinking and I was lucky not to get fined as I had messed up an establishment outside of my room.

Porn increased this year as socializing decreased, and I quickly escalated through my previous porn elements and realized I was better off with written material as the videos were not fulfilling what I sought (it was also quieter in the company of others). My search terms went to a much more extreme level and I would spend hours reading and fantasizing while avoid social situations. I also would fantasize while hungover, and with my roommate present. I began to use these processes to get myself to both wakeup and sleep, especially after my times drinking. I would blend visual, written, and moving representations of all the activities that I wanted to blend into an event in my world and exist in that state for hours.

Early in third year I must have felt accomplished after an internship and learning that I could handle a tipsy drive. I went hard into one of the first football games of the season, overdosed on alcohol, and ended up at the hospital. I did discharge myself and met up with a school administrator, but again did not consider a stop to my drinking. I again kept focused on reducing these episodes. But I built confidence to then work very hard during the week, but party recklessly. I also had instances where I would mistake rooms in group retreats and made a fool of myself by going into the wrong beds while blackout or require people to care for me while blackout.

My friends decided to set me up with his girlfriends friend and instead of staying cool headed and try to make a friendship at the least, I got drunk to the point that I left the party and walked 2 miles before I was lucky to hitchhike safely. My final year, my drinking stayed roughly the same and while I did go to jail and failed to manage my drinking at all. However, what I did notice is that once graduation happened I felt a lot more bereft of what the next part of life would bring. It felt numb and without hope. My drinking excursions diminished, but they did not ever stop, nor did I think they should. I would come home from work parties and vomit in my room. Drive drunk after some as well. And it didn’t cross my mind that was a problem. Paranoia began after a bad trip, and most other social anxieties again occurred.

******
At this stage I again lose a bit of the timeline and I know what I would do for porn would amount to edging for hours without letting myself finish. While it had started in school, it came to the primary focus after school. It would allow me to spend hours on my own and get work done, but also manage my emotions during that time. I began to start to use dating apps, but was predictably unsuccessfully. Certain “lucky” situations occurred, which were recreations of high school, but more obviously sexual. 
One grad reunion night, I went home after a party and must have believed I was home so I stripped naked to sleep cooler and avoid night terrors. A friend came down and she told me that she was hungry. Instead of being able to think through what she meant, I grabbed my phone and in a black out tried to order her some food. Another woman I met online did relate to me by being online a lot, but I freaked out when she discussed shock therapy for depression and I could never touch her. I did nothing as she had previously made it clear she had been sexually assaulted at parties.

I did end up spending time in a friends town that I went to college with, but when the night got later, we both just got blackout. I groped, but did not progress past when I stopped hearing her moaning, but it was concerning to me, that I do recall it even though it was such a foggy night in general. I do recall that later that night I mistook a closet for a bathroom and had to clean that up in the middle of the night. Similar bathroom problems also occurred while staying with other friends later that year. 

Drinking and being confused kept happening and I would end up in my previous apartments trying to reason with the new residents about where I was supposed to be. I also returned to old AirBNBs and would attempt to break in while blackout. While at festivals and with friends I would choose to take certain days off, but I also began to experience some serious digestive concerns as well while eating and drinking too aggressively. I had a habit of vomiting in hotel rooms or in airbnbs with the frequency of my college days. Experiments of drinking and taking edibles alone just to relax by myself became commonplace. This was enjoyable, but became an emotional roller coaster and I ended up texting people from work multiple times during these situations. Socially I would get kicked out of restaurants because I could not hold myself together or lose my ID and phone while out with people. The expenses, time, worry, I had in recovering my phone/wallet/ID was life changing and helped me again try to cut back. Unsuccessfully.

At this time I had developed a significant habit of masturbating to a concoction of multiple different forms of porn and regularly switching between then over multiple sessions and in a single one to keep my mind from becoming stalled. ASMR porn paired it with Porn Music videos which used rave and epileptic level flashes in scenery to up and relax my sexual stimulation. I did notice that I would come home from work and use the PMV for an upper and the ASMR videos as a downer just before bed. This would help me relax and not worry about the next day. I had scenarios where I would being reading the stories that I had found on work trips and trips to see friends and would plan to read them on the plane. I would read them on trains places (as they are more separated from each other). I also made it possible to listen to these stories while I was driving and would drive home on long road trips where I would be masturbating myself while driving, but doing so in a manner that would only be edging so that I would avoid the consequences of something more serious.

Around this time I met a series of coworkers that I tried to do initiate with and I let them into my head They helped shape my understanding of trust in friends. We played tennis, went on hikes, and went skiing. They ultimately invited me to their apartment twice, I invited them to mine once, and they flaked on me once. They would make references to their “pet names” boyfriends had and were calling them, and other emotional bids. When I recall telling them about listening to ASMR, I do recall my other coworkers “coincidentally” bringing it up the next day. Hours on the phone and at dinners with just talking about life in general and solving problems for work well into the night as well as sharing book recommendations. They argued with me and talked to me about work in ways I only now realized they had little care for. They let their guard down near me at work, not harassing, but letting clothing slip and stating things with sexual connotations I have heard and decided to do nothing about. Sky diving, a concert (where I lost my mind and grinded on one of them the entire time and lost my ability to tell directions or do anything), and other work trips and even sleep in the same bed as I did made a significant impact on my view of women in the world and how they viewed me.

I then met a friends sister (same friend as from college who set me up a lot) and she asked me out while we were on an ecstasy trip. I felt a relief like being back in high school and immediately unloaded about the 3 work friends. She would listen and seemingly understand what I was going through, but she kept at it and she and I would call once a week. Our interactions awakened a feeling of paranoia in my mind. My mother would vent on her marriage to her friends, which were mutual to my dad. Ultimately I felt a fear that if I messed up, my actions would reverberate through my friend group and ruin what little reputation I had. At this point she pointed out she only saw me as a friend. We spent time on a vacation and I didn’t initiate fearing I still didn’t understand what was happening. However, I got fed up when she visited DC for some friends and took a risk to make a move on her, that I could barely understand myself. We had sex, but about halfway through I do recall my roommate coming back and immediately having paranoia about bothering his night. So while I tried to keep going, I lost my erection. We did wake up the next day and I wanted to engage her, but I recall being very rough and ashamed for being so. Later in her home town the next month I went to a party with her and her work friends and I do not recall much besides getting drunk. Hearing her that night saying she didn’t want to have sex, and then taking that to mean she had to be explicit with me the entire rest of the trip for me to be allowed to initiate again. She never was and I remember just watching her sleep without doing anything. We ultimately had our last discussion before she left about how she wanted to just have fun and how I was not seeing what the point of fun was.

******
After this year, I ended up not only facing consequences by drinking, lusting, and smoking. This fell apart after I began to move away from the people that I worked well with even though I felt that my life was starting to change. I drove drunk and got into difficulties while driving and texting with a coworker I was interested in. This along with the breakup of the work team, and a fight with one of the coworkers led me into a spiral that culminated in a multiple instances of driving drunk and then blacking out and losing my phone, wallet, and laptop. I identified and took action on staying sober at this point, though I cannot recall the exact reason for joining the support group I did. I did keep smoking for a few months, but I was a regular dick in any social situation and otherwise I would just collapse in my head and not talk to anyone depending on the level of the high.

About 3 months into sobriety I realized that porn was either just as bad or worse than the drinking. Namely the days I would lose to hangovers would become ever more lost due to the weekends spent masturbating. I had also started to use anonymous browsers and started making accounts for online forums to view the content. I did start interacting with people as well, but it was largely as a means to streamline and encourage more content rather than actively trying to provide my own. This also became a period of time during which I realized how much masturbation would help me sleep as my two weeks of avoiding it resulted in poor sleep and restless mornings. I lasted about two weeks without porn once. But I would start to travel and land myself in situations where I would spend entire nights on my own in different cities instead of with people in the support groups, with friends, or more importantly just resting.

I did end up meeting two other women online, and I enjoyed one’s company (though she did admit to scamming from an online marketplace). She ultimately took the lead in getting me into her room on our second date, but seemed to know the entire time that she could do that and that I wouldn’t have the ability to lead her there myself. She tried to have sex, but I was still not happy with my last performance, so I settled for lesser options and didn’t meet her view on it as a one night stand maturely for a while. I made a female friend in one of my groups and when speaking with her one on one, she openly told me about her skills at oral, but that she didn’t like to talk about it. I decided to mock her for how she changed her moods and said terrible things to her via text, to which she has since stopped talking to me. This repeated itself with a friend from college. I would repeatedly talk down about myself and question her decision making for her past experiences she was describing to me. In both cases I was actively trying to avoid intimacy in order to just get to sex if possible.

On a trip with the red cross I ended up meeting a woman also volunteering but on a different shift. I didn’t have the guts to exchange numbers immediately and another volunteer was kind enough to initiate that for me. Effectively we did chat, but I decided I had no chance at some point and while I believe she was trying, I stopped. Attended a wedding where I could have at least tried to talk to one of the bridesmaids. I made a fear based decision not to do so. Then I drank I glass of champagne and started to follow whiskey around the party and decided to bail out of the situation.

For about another year, I would keep this process going of intermittently watching or reading porn and my interests began to shift to harder mainstream avenues (along with the industry in general) but I would also find myself reading and listening to interviews of the actresses and sometimes other performers and began to feel drawn to them as people and less of an urge to partake in watching their actions. Rather I wanted to start getting involved in the actions myself. I was then unable to stop for many circumstances and while I would work to avoid cannibalism and death porn, I would make slips into that and PMV and hardcore aspects. In affect, I would go to meetings to work to remove this urge and know that I had just come from watching porn and that I would go right back to it.

******
My perspective alternates now between viewpoints that are summarized by the below:

At this point, I cannot keep sexual imagery out of my head when interacting with women and repeatedly get frustrated by not being able to talk to them long enough to at least discuss that topic. I have tried to engage in erotic writing, but fail to put in the real time/effort to make that a reality. I have lost long term determination to create and develop an artistic skill. I repeatedly binge and purge with respect to physical fitness, socializing, adrenaline, and entertainment now and it is a daily struggle not to just watch porn. There is a good chance that when I read this I may have already slipped that day.

I get that it takes time to learn these things, but it’s a daily struggle at the moment to confirm I want to. I did see people at gyms try to speak with me and avoided them and I know that as time goes on I sense that I will want less and less to do with women. Due to sheer frustration. I understand I have to keep trying and persevere, but there’s a time to reflect on whether I am not following my path.

But every day, I feel a sense of hope that I can overcome small elements of these social and emotional fears that I have been working for years to avoid. Whether it happens is unknown. But I hope that my time working on this will give others hope that there will be a chance to overcome theirs in time. Most importantly of all is the belief that all of the women and men that have played unnecessarily dedicated roles in helping me see where I currently am can also exist for others as long as people are willing to put aside their normal social norms and find those that are hiding behind their fears. If you have made it this far, you probably are someone who is capable of doing just that. So do not give up and only pick 1 or 2 favorites to improve the days of. Fight to be a beacon of hope for all who are suffering, whether they demonstrate they deserve it or not."
461,Anxiety w/family time,Anxiety,Visiting family and already upset my sisters b/c I left early w/my fiancée to go take out dog out to do his business after being inside 6 hrs. Does anyone else feel caught up between trying to make family and fiancée happy. I just feel like I’m always anxious trying to get everyone to spent time w/me and each other. Never fails someone always feels hurt or shorted
462,"I have serious anxiety about my health, any advice plz?",Anxiety,"I noticed I have anxiety disorder in the middle of this year and it kept getting worse. Right now I am desperately anxious about my little surgery(cutting a mole) the day after tmr. I did a lot of medical check-up and most things turned out fine. But I still don’t have faith in my own health. I did turn to a psychologist but I haven’t really start the course of treatment. I thought about taking pills but those side effects really frightened me, and I read all these stories about ppl get too rely on pills. And I tried exercise but I’m anxious even right after the exercise. 

I really need some help."
463,Panick attacks after moving from my parents home,Anxiety,"Hello everyone,   


For some title context, I had a quite overprotective education and was really attached to my parents and all these moments with them and our cats, well the home overall, and when I was in my bed for the first night away, I realised that it was over and felt a tidal wave that resembled to a mourning and quicly turned into a panick attack.   


I realised for the first time that it was all meant to end and by extent everything will, even my parent's life, and that doubled the panick..   


I know this is a lack of maturity, and in a sense it's for the best to realise this at some point, but if I feel better after talking to my parents, anxiety and tears come back after a while.  


Any advices or stories to share people?"
464,Worried about my mother,Anxiety,My mother is diabetic and lately her blood sugar has been high. It’s been averaging between 170-190 and that has been freaking me out. Is that dangerous for a diabetic? She’s on meds.
465,What are some of your bad habits that your anxiety has caused?,Anxiety,I can not stop biting my nails for the life of me. I really want to grow my nails so i can paint them and so i do not have to spend loads of false nails because mine will be lomg already. Now i am biting the hard skin around my nails as an alternative.
466,Work anxiety,Anxiety,"I just put in my first case at work that I did on my own and immediatly got chills and shaky.. I know that even of there is something wrong it will be fine, because people here seem to make a lot of mistakes, just scared of having done everything wrong..."
467,Anyone else hate group chats?,Anxiety,"I’m in a group chat with my mates and I swear it’s like I’m ignored 90 percent of the time while the other three chat, I posted in there today and my post was totally ignored while literally five minutes later they were talking. I’m thinking about leaving the chat it’s not worth it to me"
468,Is this really a panic/anxiety attack?,Anxiety,"I have been previously diagnosed with anxiety as a direct result of these experiences but I'm second guessing it. I'm just curious if anyone else has panic/anxiety attacks like these, I guess I just need some reassurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday morning I got very upset. I couldn't calm down and it was getting time to go to work so I took phenibut (which usually calms me down), and had another energy drink (bringing my total for the day up to 2).

&amp;#x200B;

4 hours into my shift and I was still pretty upset, my coworkers went to smoke (a blunt) and asked if I wanted a hit so I took it.  Not to long after I started to

* Hallucinate.
* Get very dizzy.
* Get extremely hot.
* Get extremely nauseous.
* Lose my vision.
* Lose my hearing.
* Lose control of my body.

It was then that I asked my coworker to cover for me so I could use the bathroom. I thought I might puke so I stood over the toilet but everything started to get even more intense, and I started to black out. I went to the sink to put cold water on my scorching head and kept hitting my head on the mirror because I could not longer hold myself up to well.

&amp;#x200B;

I opened the bathroom door thinking I should have someone call 911, but forget I undid my belt to relieve pressure on my stomach. I shut the door to get my belt back on and the next time I opened my eyes I was on the floor, sitting on my knees against the wall... I heard a bang before I opened my eyes to this so I assume I passed out and hit my head. It hurt pretty bad and still does honestly. After this experience everything felt like a game, not real.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the symptoms I experienced are 

* Hallucinating.
* Dizziness.
* Hot flashes I'm assuming, it felt like i was on fire.
* Vision loss.
* Hearing loss.
* Loss of consciousness.
* Nausea.
* Motor control loss.
* De-realization.
* De-personalization? (I didn't feel real).

This intense episode lasted what felt like a couple minutes, not sure how long it actually lasted. Usually it takes at least a month for me to fully recover from these. Does anyone else have these kind of panic/anxiety attacks? Or should I schedule an appointment with my doctor to have some tests done?  I also felt like everywhere about an inch away from my eyes were numb, don't know if they were but they had that feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

They usually happen whenever I'm very worked up about something, mainly when I'm mad and stressed out. It made work very difficult (I work night shift). And my manager told me I looked awful, my skin was pretty pale and so were my lips from what I seen. I would've liked to be sent home but they probably though I was just high, if only they knew. But I guess they don't get paid enough to care.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice/reassurance is greatly appreciated. I added a trigger flag to be on the safe side, I'm not sure if my experience will trigger anyone or not. If I said something against the rules I can reformat this, I don't believe I have though. Sorry if anything seems out of place or does not make sense, I'm still collecting myself."
469,Is it normal to just not want to hang out with your friends,Anxiety,About 3 months ago I played with my friends every day on xbox but for 3 months now I have had no desire to hang out with them I want to but everything feels weird. I normally overthink things but I have had this in my mind for 2 moths now
470,Startling at every unexpected thing that happens around me?,Anxiety,"Recently i developed a new anxiety issue/symptom, which is that my body seems to startle at almost everything. 

For example, when someone suddenly starts talking to me out of nowhere i will startle and sometimes even faint from the startle (vagus nerve related i think). 

Or some unexpected noise like a car driving by or someone knocking on my door, i will startle and feel dizzy for a few seconds-a minute before i can take action/respond. 

Does anyone have this as a symptom? If so, how do you handle it?"
471,I filed a complaint and didn’t even stutter or panic once,Anxiety,"I used to not even be able to pick up the phone to answer but holy fuck I just called the hospital and filed a complaint and said absolutely everything right. 

My mother has some kind of serious infection, she’s got extreme abdominal pain, vomiting, migraines, fainting, etc. She went to the hospital yesterday and they took her blood and found increased white blood cells, but just gave her antibiotics and they don’t know what it is. 

This morning she went again because the pain was way too intense. A hospital doctor came in an hour late, said her urine sample had blood in it, and told her that SHES JUST ON HER FUCKING PERIOD. 

I was INFURIATED. Doctors are known to downplay women’s pain because they just don’t believe them. He didn’t even bother to look at her chart and see that she has an increased white blood cell count aka an infection. He came in there just hoping to dismiss her and go the fuck home. 

So I picked up the damn phone, called them, asked for the manager and just told her it all, in perfect order, without even looking at notes to help me speak!!!! I’ve honestly never done it before. There was zero hesitation at all and I don’t feel any anxiety after, I know I did the right thing and I didn’t mess up while speaking once!!!

I’m so proud of myself. I’m so happy I did that."
472,Anxiety while driving.,Anxiety,I was rushing myself to the hospital after work the other day in a heavy rain and spun out my truck into an intersection that thankfully was empty. I'm just wondering at what point is enough enough and I won't be able to take this anymore.
473,Can't sleep cuz I'm worried I'll die,Anxiety,"Been struggling to let myself fall asleep or stay asleep because I keep worrying I'll die in my sleep. I know it's not logical. It's only been the past few days. I keep thinking I'll have a heart attack in my sleep or something and my husband will wake up and shake me but I won't move. I'm a light sleeper and usually wake up multiple times in the night but usually go right back to sleep. It's been harder to go right back to sleep cuz I think, ""Yay, I'm still alive."" Just wanted to vent. It's so illogical. I'm sure it'll go away in a week or two. Thanks for reading."
474,Progress,Anxiety,"After chaining down a job at Amazon I've reintroduced some structure into my life , I think this is helping with my anxiety I feel like a productive member of society and its sort of a distraction from myself I tend to over think a lot of stuff but I'm just going to chill save my money and take everyday as the blessings that they are thanks to this sub I've realized I'm not the only one!"
475,my biggest trigger is when people pretend to have anxiety.,Anxiety,"To begin, i have been DIAGNOSED with GAD, as well as depression, and panic disorder. 

As the title says, nothing, and i repeat, NOTHING bugs me more than a mentally healthy person claiming to have anxiety. Acting like it’s some sort of trend, or cool thing to have. Ive seen this in my daily life, as well as the internet. I can’t even scroll tik-tok without seeing some kid claiming to have anxiety. They literally will sit in their rooms, record themselves crying and tell the internet it’s due to a mental illness and getting 4 million likes. It’s what gets the views i guess, mental illness is the new wave. 

I’m not going to sit here and pretend i know what they go through off camera, but when you record and post videos of yourself spazzing out, pulling chunks of hair from your head because you’re listening to a certain frequency, i have to believe you’re either putting on a show or absolutely insane. 

i am 19 years old, and i spent an entire year of my life having 3 to 4 DAILY panic attacks. (give or take depending on the day, not completely accurate.) i spent an entire year getting around 3 or less hours of sleep per night because i thought i was dying in my sleep. i spent an entire year LIVING inside of my fight or flight mode, thinking death was around every single fucking turn, no matter how innocent a situation. i spent an entire year in hell, tormented by my own brain, and to see this become some sort of fucking trend? it’s just disrespectful..

i just don’t get it"
476,Why does my son hit his arm?,Anxiety,"My 14 y/o son struggles with significant anxiety and depression. When  his anxiety is high I have seen him hitting one arm with his other hand. I don't think it has ever been hard enough to leave a bruise, I'm not sure if he is even consciously doing this. I asked him why and he didn't know."
477,Plane anxiety,Anxiety,"I have a flight tmrw &amp; I’m having terrible anxiety 
all I can think about is plane crash &amp; death"
478,NSFW I’m freaking out. I feel like my body is trying to kill me,Anxiety,Since Tuesday I’ve had this pain in my testicle like it’s irritated. It hasn’t gone away so today in the shower I felt around and checked. I felt a bump on the bottom of my testicle around where it hurts. I can’t tell if it’s on the testicle or below it but now I’m freaking out I feel like I wanna cry. Is this cancer??? Can this be anything besides cancer? And how can I tell my dad I wanna set a doctors appointment up because he’s been saying he thinks it’s just growing pains? Also how can I tell him I found a bump without it being awkward? Should I tell him now or wait a few days to see if it goes away?
479,Anxiety - Sending Work Emails,Anxiety,"Does anyone have really bad anxiety sending emails for work? 

I have been nervous for hours. I sent an email today before leaving for my vacation. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting the hang of things at work. However, I don't feel completely confident like everything I'm saying is correct. I know my boss is really hoping that I'm more independent and take more initiative, but I still don't completely understand everything. My partner says I suffer from ""imposter syndrome"". Anyway, I responded to an email where many people were cc'd and I can't stop thinking about how they might respond. Will it be so apparent that I don't have a complete grasp on everything, will it be offensive? I proofread it a million times...what's difficult is the weekend is here and I will be on vacation for a week. I will be so tempted to check my email, but I try to force myself to disconnect from work when I'm on vacation so I don't want to check my email. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet since I'm anticipating their responses."
480,Almost every morning I get so nauseous I puke.,Anxiety,"In the last 10 months my anxiety has gotten really bad. I wake up before my alarms because I toss and turn with a stomach ache every morning. This morning I was feeling especially nauseous and of course ending up puking. Except this time I also somehow threw out my back while doing this. 

I know this is just a way my body is reacting to stress, but I wish my days didn’t have to get off to such a difficult start."
481,Make it stop,Anxiety,How do I stop it I took my meds I'm listening to relaxing music but in back on the urge of anxeity and hallucinations i want it too stop I just wanna quit if you know you know but please I had such a good day and I'm up at 4 am posting on reddit listing to eminem I mean I cant barely focused bc my anxiety is so bad it is fucking up my life I wish it would stop.
482,The Cycle,Anxiety,"How many of you are familiar with this cycle?

Hyper-analyzing physical feelings &gt; downward mental spiral of certain impending doom &gt; looking for momentary relief (“checking out”) with a couple drinks at night &gt; poor sleep &gt; wakeful anxiety at night over bad health habits &gt; too much coffee in the morning to try and make up for bad sleep &gt; over caffeinated and poor sleep physical effects &gt; right back to hyper-analyzing physical feelings and repeat, day after day"
483,Dealing with anxiety in the early stages of a relationship,Anxiety,"I’m going to admit that this is probably really stupid, but my partner and I have been dating for about a month and I’ve been having a lot of intrusive thoughts ever since we became exclusive. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve become really overwhelmed and started crying, and I’m not really sure if/how I should bring this up. My partner knows I’m on anti-depressants and hasn’t asked about why because they’re not one to ask personal questions and I’m not one to openly disclose information. Again, this is probably a really stupid problem to be having, but any advice would be really nice."
484,how do i know if i’m overreacting?,Anxiety,"i went to get a general check-up earlier — not because i had a health problem, but mainly because i just wanted to assess my health and i wanted to maximize my healthcare card from work. i told the doctor that i had no specific problems, i just wanted to get checked. and i just felt like the doctor was condescending and dismissive about it? she said “so you just went to a check-up to use up your healthcare plan, but you have no problem?” in a tone that was giving a message that i’m wasting her time going to a check-up even if i’m not sick. i immediately got super anxious and started second guessing myself about whether it’s okay to get a check-up even if i’m not sick. also, while i was  just mentioning that i had no specific problem she cut in and said “then why are you fat?” or “why is your weight like that?” idk, she could have brought it up in a different way? it’s not about what she said, but how she said it. i’ve gone to other doctors who advised me about my weight, and they never said it like that ahhdjd, like how does she want me to answer that? i feel like such a weak person, but i just felt  so anxious and cried after. now looking back, how i felt like the doctor was really rude to me, but some part of me is questioning my response— was i overreacting? idk and i can’t stop thinking about it"
485,Last night I had the worst panic attack.,Anxiety,"I couldn't breathe properly, I was shaking and it was really cold even though I was sweating. It probably lasted for like 20 minutes and after I could finally get my thoughts together I made myself believe that I did that for attention even though I was the only one in the room. After all that I decided to talk to some people on Reddit about a problem I had yesterday after school because I always overthink everything. Even if it wasn't my fault, I will still make myself think that there is something terribly wrong with me. I can't talk to anyone without panicking, because I can't stop thinking, what if I say something wrong? What if the other person thinks that I'm annoying? I always think about the worst thing that can happen. Even for the small things. I would be carrying a bowl of noodles and I would think how I could just drop it. Or when I got a new phone I was constantly thinking how I could just toss it out the window. I hate the way my brain works."
486,Advice wanted: husband and I both suffer from anxiety,Anxiety,"Does anybody have any advice on how to support each other when we are both feeling anxious? We're working on our communication, but we can find this difficult when feeling our worst. We often worry about upsetting each other and this can spiral out of control quite quickly. We are both in therapy but, especially with distancing, we aren't making much progress."
487,So um hi?,Anxiety,"First time posting so idk how this works.
Okay long story short. I’m anxious. I’m bi. And I’m kinda having an identity crisis. I finish high school (exams) in two days and I’m shitting myself for this last exam and the results that will follow. COVID has been a punch in the gut. I just wanna get out. I don’t know who I can talk to anymore. I have trust issues. And I feel myself succumbing to ‘old habits’ if that makes sense. How do I stop myself from spiralling?

I don’t expect any help. It’s just nice to vent and that it’s out there without people dismissing how I feel or just shrugging it off like I’m overreacting."
488,Anxiety induced from extreme fighting from parents. I need help.,Anxiety,"hi. ive never posted here before but I'm an 18 year old girl who's struggled with anxiety my whole life. ever since I can remember I've been on edge, just always worrying that something bad is gonna happen, that kind of thing. but I've known what anxiety feels like, I've felt it.

in the past week my anxiety has gotten so bad it feels like a different type of anxiety. I'm getting nauseous, it feels like constant panic. And it stems from my dad.

My dad is an alcoholic, (recovering, but has relapsed a lot and drinks occasionally, hides liquor from my mom etc.) and has a HUGE anger problem. some of my earliest memories as a child was hearing my dad slam the door upstairs and start screaming bloody murder at my mom and I knew that was my cue to go to my room and put my headphones in.

stuff was okay for a while but never got resolved. the other day I got into a very minor argument with my mom over something trivial, that me and her were just about done figuring out. and my dad interjects and starts raising his voice at me saying I need to watch the way I talk to my mom.  and I kinda snapped and said ""maybe I don't like the way YOU talk to MY mom, dad."" and he lost it. he fucking lost it and me and my mom both said we'd never seen or heard him yell and scream this loud and my mom looked frightened so I took out my phone and told my dad I was gonna call 911. he said if I did that, that it would be, and I quote, ""the last fucking phone call I'll ever make and I'll smash that fucking phone to pieces."" I panicked in that second. My dad is supposed to be my protector, care for me, and here he is saying if I call 911 it would be the last call I'd ever make.

I broke down crying and ran to my room, felt like I had my first ever mental breakdown. ever since then there's been little things each day with them, my dad apparently ""bullying"" my mom into changing some password with some finance thing because my mom wants to leave him and I don't know how all that works, but when my mom said my dad was bullying her I broke down again.

ive been bullied, I know that pain. and I guess where I'll leave off here is I've had it. my mind hurts, I'm in a state of panic, disgust, confusion, pain, I don't even fucking know what anymore. i honestly have felt suicidal the last couple of days and I need help. I know I need to go to therapy but I've been working a lot and just haven't called one yet. i just want a normal life."
489,Social anxiety,Anxiety,"Used to not experience this and not have anxiety like this. But recently it seems when my anxiety worsened people around me are starting to ignore and stay away more from me and sometimes even insulted? I really hate talking or going around people now and I can’t even say a single word without thinking of being ignored again or laugh at I also think people are talking behind my back all the time. 

Any idea how to cope around social anxiety because it’s been super hard."
492,Does going back to your family home during the holidays raise anyone else's anxiety????,Anxiety,Last time I was home I was living with my family over the summer and quarantining with them... I am currently a junior in College and live on my own in a house with a couple other roommates. Last time I was home I ended up going through the worst of my anxiety/depression/ocd during the summer and had series of panic attacks and ended up getting medicated and receiving therapy. I am feeling much better now! :) And felt a lot better after I got out of my  family house. Now that I'm back for the holidays I feel all this pressure and stress and I almost feel guilty for feeling this way. My parents fight a lot and I know that's they're problem but sometimes it adds to my stress/anxiety... just wanted to vent ❤️ happy holidays everyone
493,Weird anxiety symptom??,Anxiety,"Hi! My name is Dane and I am a 16 y/o male with GAD and I have recently been struggling extra with health anxiety, i’m assuming to the current situation the world is in. I have been hospitalized before with anxiety issues and have had countless panic/anxiety attacks but tonight i’m having a symptom that I don’t recognize, and it’s fairly alarming. I feel like i’m being poked in the heart... if that makes sense. It feels like somebody is giving me a shot but in my heart?? I also have some tightness and a “crushing” feeling which I also don’t recognize. I also have some SOB, which is uncomfortable, but not unusual (it doesn’t scare me as much because I have a Pulse Ox to reassure myself that I CAN breathe 😂). Most of the chest feelings I get from anxiety are just tightness. These sensations have been going on for the last hour without going away, and I have been trying to calm down, but nothing is working well. I really want some reassurance that this is okay."
494,Jobs,Anxiety,"So this past year I finally got the part-time job that I've been wanting forever. Just a reception desk in student housing at the university. I love it and the people are great and I'm learning more everyday... but recently I've been struggling with my mental health - I've had panic attacks at work and had to leave early once. There are different shifts - regular 8 hour shifts or shorter lunch cover shifts, stuff like that. For some reason I find the shorter shifts easier to manage so I keep trying to pick those up but I feel like such a loser for dumping my 8 hour shifts lately because I feel like I anticipate too much and maybe the time commitment of it (I might be a little agoraphobic lately too) just gives me more anxiety and a depressing pit in my stomach. I'm just sad because I really wanted to work more than I am..."
495,"How to stop triggering my own anxiety? My brain won’t shut up, ever",Anxiety,"I hate being alone for this exact reason. My brain goes crazy when im alone and it doesn’t stop. I have tried so many things including therapy and breathing exercises, exposure therapy, medication etc. But it only helps when i’m not alone. As soon as i’m alone at my apartment, even with the tv on, my anxious thoughts start spiraling back again and i drive myself crazy.

Any advice on how to break this spiral?"
496,"honestly, i dont like my birthday",Anxiety,"today its my birthday, now here something you guys probably wont expect

I wish my birthday can be quiet, alone.

and now its fking quarantine just stay at home why would you still want to gather the family. just waste of time man. I wish i could just STAY HOME and celebrate with my family, THAT'S ALL, NOT FORMING AN ILLEGAL GATHERING AND WASTE MY WONDERFUL SATURDAY"
498,Sometimes I Just Want To Hide Away From Everyone,Anxiety,"Sometimes small things bother me.. It could be a single word I said that I think was out of place, an innocent mistake, or a full on disaster.  When I go in public people look at me.. mostly men. I know they mean to stare as a compliment  to my looks, but I hate it and the fact that random people think I'm attractive bothers me. It makes me more insecure.. random people shouldn't care enough to judge much less look me up and down. 
I try not too think too much.. my thoughts make me uncomfortable  sometimes. Sometimes I think back on social interactions and I cringe, and I literally want to disappear. Most of the time it's something stupid that other people have probably long forgotten.. but it bothers me and it's hard to just ignore it. 
Sometimes my boyfriend makes little comments, and I know he doesn't mean anything by them. But they bother me nonetheless.  I dont bring it up because I know it's silly, and I know I shouldn't let them bother me. None of this should bother me. 
After years of anxiety I'm beginning  to learn, that even when it comes out of nowhere there is a trigger. somewhere.  something did it, something set off that fear. Fear of being judged, fear of rejection, fear of change.. or maybe all of them. 
I've had alot of bad dreams lately, and some anxiety too. I know that having a new relationship and planning to move, not to mention changes with my family and job, are all contributing. 
How can I get ahold of myself? How can I stop the worries I know are invalid? How can I help myself?"
499,"I had an auditory ptsd trigger, that was new to me tw",Anxiety,"The man who s*******y a***ulted me was my ex, previously. When we were together, he usually woke up before me, and would listen to a twitch streamer until I woke up. 

Sometimes he’d fall asleep listening too. It was always quiet, but I would be able to recognize the voice. 

My roommate was excited about a big stream of his tonight, I wanted to talk so I said set it up in here. I knew it was that streamer but I didn’t think twice. 

It felt like a ton of bricks on my chest when I heard him again. It was like hearing my ex. 
I kept quiet about it, it wasn’t horrible but it made me kinda want to retreat into isolation. 
I can’t sleep now. I have to be up for work in two hours. Ugh.

Slight format edit"
500,Anxiety? bipolar?,Anxiety,"sometimes i feel a lot of confidence even when im going outside, i feel good, my stance are good, the way i talk and everything... but then after awhile i feel myself draining, feeling hydraited then i want to be alone in my room. this keeps happening and i wonder if i can make myself stable. and also if this is what anxiety means"
501,Checking in while thinking of all of you,Anxiety,"I want to know how Thanksgiving has treated you this year? Did you challenge yourself and achieve a goal? Did you set boundaries and follow through? 

How was your holiday? 

I was thinking of all of you the whole day knowing that many of you will experience high stress situations and need a lot of love and support to cope with the anxiety. I wish you all the best ❤

I chose to set boundaries and be at home without family because going out is not where I am at in my journey. Although, where I chose self care in one boundary I chose to still push myself and clean my house and visit the store which is unusual for me. It was a small challenge to still feel successful

It doesn't have to be all push, push, push. Be lenient with yourself and kind and understand because you didn't do one thing doesn't mean you can't try to push other boundaries. 

Thats my brain dump lol 🤣❤"
502,Does anyone ever feel like they are in a constant state of mild dizziness,Anxiety,I can feel dizzy when walking around my house without feeling anxious. I have had anxiety and dizziness at the same time but when I’m dizzy and not anxious it scares me. I have thought maybe I’m anxious without knowing and that’s why I’m dizzy. Or maybe it’s because I have had high anxiety for almost a year and this is the after effects. I don’t really have health issues and my doctor doesn’t really think it’s necessary to do an mri on my brain because it’s very unlikely I have an issue in my brain.
503,I need help distracting myself during longer work hours.,Anxiety,"So I'm working 60 hours a week and I constantly deal with unrealistic intense situations in my head. I have no one to talk to and I can't listen to music. I can't take time off unless I test positive for corona.

I have to last until Xmas eve where we'll be allowed to use vacation time as we please."
505,i cant imagine being on a plane bc of my anxiety,Anxiety,is anyone else too afraid to travel? not that i would travel during a pandemic but if there wasn’t one honestly i cant imagine i would be too scared of being in unfamiliar places because i’d be too afraid of getting an anxiety episode or a panic attack especially on a plane (not that i have a fear of planes it’s just the anxiety) or in the middle of no where..
506,Have had a (probably) migraine all night. My anxiety wants me to go to the hospital in case it's something worse.,Anxiety,"Started getting a headache last night, and it built into a migraine. Ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) didn't get rid of it. This is probably because it's coming up to my period and sometimes I get really painkiller-resistant headaches around then.

It's almost 8:30 now. Haven't slept. The pain is mostly gone now, but the nausea and general weak/off feeling remain, quite powerfully. I'm getting tingling/itchiness on my scalp that's freaking me out too.

The thing is, I know a lot about the brain and strokes and stuff and know that they don't usually present like this. But my anxiety is scared anyway.

Maybe it would help if others could tell me their horrible headache stories?"
507,Gad hair loss?,Anxiety,My anxiety has always been bad but especially these  last couple of months. I'm a women but I started to notice my hair thinning especially around my hair line. Anyone else deal with this?
508,My anxiety is at an all time high and my doctor mentioned medication - should I go for it or try some natural methods?,Anxiety,"I've struggled with anxiety for years now, but I've always thought of it as due to being traumatized by my parents deaths and not so much me having a disorder all on its own if that makes sense. They had both died from illness when I was 17 and I'm 24 now. About 3-4 years ago I moved away from my hometown and my anxiety has improved quite a bit since I've been here, but it's never fully gone away.  Anyways, this year with covid has been a struggle, since I broke up with my boyfriend during lockdown and had to move out of his place. I finally found an apartment with a roommate (I don't know her very well) but I'm still very isolated because my friends all moved away during the lockdown (well except for 1). I hardly ever see my one friend and only speak to my other friends on occasion. And my family isn't close so I don't speak to them either. And my anxiety is SO BAD right now. Because this year I also happened to start school, and working part time, and doing horse back riding on the side. I have become so tired and my grades are suffering so much, not even sure I can get through the semester. The high anxiety attacks during the day from the stress and not having anyone to call when I'm stressed just makes me so exhausted. I have a therapist through the school but I barely have time to make appointments with him because of my schedule. 

Anyways, after explaining my situation to my doctor he suggested I go on medication for severe anxiety. I get where he's coming from with this but I'm very apprehensive. I've always just wanted to balance myself out naturally instead. The biggest thing I have with anxiety is worrying that things won't be okay (from my parents I guess). And I have really bad fatigue lately that's really impacting the goals I have. I ended up dropping a class next semester and telling my work to schedule me less hours so that will likely help to make time for relaxation. But I'm not sure if I should try the medication too or not. I'm just really lost and I don't have anyone of reference in my life for this. Any advice would be appreciated."
509,The constant loop of socializing,Anxiety,"Hey I’m new to this subreddit.
Does anyone have a really hard time replying to texts from loved ones and friends? It takes me a couples days to a week or even a month to reply back. I also avoid any means of video calls. I have some friends who understand and are supportive, but others not so much. There’s this stigma that you’re supposed to reply as soon as possible, if not it could make the other person feel ghosted or feel unimportant. I feel like a horrible person sometimes for acting this way. Wanted to know if there are other people like me. 
I’m a 22 year old female!"
510,Anxiety made my hair fall out,Anxiety,"So I was in a relationship that I didn't really want to be in but my ex-partner kept trying to push me to be in the relationship with him. Throughout the whole course of our relationship I would spend 1-2 hours thinking about whether I am making the right decision or not and thinking how our future would work out together. All this stress caused telogen effluvium and half my hair fell out, I looked VERY bald and it really broke my confidence. It's been a few months (5) and it's growing back now but I am still shook that happened and hope it never happens again."
511,I get really bad anxiety when my SO plays video games with his old friends.,Anxiety,"I’m just venting 

My SO plays video games with his old high school friends. He does this in “seasons” for example if a new game comes out. Then after a month or so he gets bored of it and doesn’t play with them for months. But the times he does play with them makes me really anxious. 

One reason why is his “friends” can really piss him off. As many others he can get really upset when not doing well at the game or sometimes the teamwork is shitty or someone brings up politics. Unfortunately for me he does not have a good hold on his anger, and like fire can light up any situation he encounters after playing with these old friends. Often he will get snappy with me as a result of being mad at them. I’m a very anxious and previously abused person so any kind of slight anger really freaks me out. 

Besides that I know his friends don’t respect our relationship. For instance they may try and talk about women who they went to high school with in a sexual way around him. They will even pass around nude photos in a group chat. Number 1 I find that incredibly sexist and a complete invasion of those ladies privacy. These “men” have been out of high school looooong enough to stop that kind of disgusting “guy talk”
Thankfully I haven’t heard my SO be receptive and even asked me to go into his phone to delete a photo of a naked old class mate because he didn’t want to see it. Still. It gives me anxiety thinking about it. 

Just wanted to get that out. I feel a tiny bit better but not really. And no, I will not remove myself from the situation because I’d rather hear what they are talking about than be anxious not knowing"
512,I stood up to my boss and took him to HR now my anciety is thru the roof,Anxiety,I took my boss to hr for harrassement and i  have had these past couple of days off but i go back to work tommorrow and my anxiety is killing me
513,Could this be Anxiety?,Anxiety,"Hey guys. I've (22 male) been having some symptoms that I think could be anxiety or a culmination of stress or both.

I have had GAD (general anxiety disorder) my whole life, but only manifests when an event is associated with it. Only two events have happened that have triggered it. The first was when I was little. That issue was solved completely. The second was three years ago, after I spent a night without sleep. I associated anxiety with sleep and I still suffer today. Not as bad as most, I usually get 7-8 hours but sometimes I get 5 or 6 hours of sleep. I have never been given drugs or anything for it. But I manage.

Lately I have been having pretty bad brain fog (feels like I take ages to figure things out) and at night when I'm trying to sleep my thoughts of the day mix with my ability to sleep. For e.g. I'm build an app at the moment and last night my brain kept telling me to finish the app before I can go to sleep. Eventually at 3am I passed out because I was so tired. Also I have been waking up 2 to 4 times a night (I usually only wake up once to pee.). 

Other noteworthy things to consider... I am a developer so this year with covid have spent a lot of time indoors. I haven't been exercising other than walking for an hour every few days. And I just finished my final year at University last week (which was a crazy amount of stress on top of covid).

My Q is. Could my inability to relax when falling asleep and brain fog be caused by a culmination of the past year, covid, Uni etc? And should I consider meds for short term? And have any of year had similar symptoms from some sort of low-hanging anxiety

Last note: I never had brain fog before this year, even when I got little sleep. I also suspect it could be my sinuses (I have had a history of bad sinuses) or lack of vitamin D?"
514,Anxiety stopping me from progressing in life,Anxiety,"Hey im just mainly looking for others input but im a 26 yo male who's struggled with depression and anxiety since early high school, it used to be my depression was worse but now im finding my anxiety is worse so they switched places, my anxiety stops me from going out and socializing with family and friends, stops me from committing to any relationships, stops me from hanging out with anyone, im trying hard to break free from it but its so difficult when that voice is always in the back of your head telling you youre not good enough or convincing yourself not to go on that date. Its to the point where its crippling me from improving myself at all, I try to stay active and goto the gym everyday, I try my best to feel normal or happy. But im always in my head I cant turn off my conscience. Social interactions are difficult so I avoid them. I feel so trapped and alone idk what to do or where to go."
515,life's kinda a cosmic horror,Anxiety,"hey all, hope you're doing okay. if you're not in the best of mind, i don't recommend reading further because this covers some distressing stuff. REALLY distressing.

&amp;#x200B;

okay, ready?

&amp;#x200B;

alright.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a very stupid decision to watch exurb1a a few nights ago, in particular ""Sleep is just Death Being Shy"". This struck me with the horrible thoughts of death that I've not had since I was little, now come to the realisation that I'm going to die no matter what (which I actually knew before).

Because of that, the past few days have been agonizing and hopeless in that I have no control over it, that I was birthed into this world without consent and my only choice is to face the abyss ahead of me. It made me de-realize for several days, actually, wondering what the point of it all was if I was basically on death's waiting list.

&amp;#x200B;

But it's not death itself that frustrates me. As I said, I always knew I was going to die one day. It's the gut-wrenching anxiety that does it, how your mind spirals around, your breath sharpens and you can practically feel your heart pound against your chest as you think of a way, ANY WAY, to get out of your predicament. I wanna make peace with it before I do die, that I can pass on peacefully to... whatever lies beyond there. If there is anything.

The Caretaker's Everything at the End of Time elicited these same feelings of horror in me, that as I grow older I run the risk of slowly losing every memory I've ever made as I become a hollow shell of myself. And again, you can't really escape it outside of being put down.

Thus, it dawned on me the true horror of life. You're spat out into the world and given consciousness with no choice, the only thing certain that one day you'll be plunged into an abyss blacker than sleep without even realizing; either that or slowly unravelling into a drooling, useless shell of yourself. All of the struggles, with school and work and taxes seem... dwarfed, compared to the cosmic horror that awaits us all at the end, doesn't it?

Oh well. It is a while off, and you really won't recognise when you die. It's just making peace with it, and living life without fear. Even though right now, the thoughts invade every so often and frighten me every second I think on them. God bless anyone going through this too."
516,cant sleep,Anxiety,"its not very late in the night right now, just almost 2am. I've been feeling very paranoid or just anxious these last few nights. I cant really focus on anything thats happening either because of it if that makes sense. I've covered my mirrors with blankets and it most definitely helped but how anxious I am is making me nauseous (as usual but it doesn't make me hate it any less). I can't really go to sleep on my own at all in the state because even if i end up falling asleep I have terrible nightmares. These past days i've had one every night and waking up in the middle of the night makes me even more anxious to sleep because of this one terrifying experience I had with it. Anyways, I might just go to my moms room and sleep there since it helps me sleep better sometimes. I cant keep doing that though of course, she's made it clear she doesnt like how much space i take up on the bed either so there you have it for you. I just want to sleep peacefully. I dont even know why this is happening I used to be able to go to sleep just fine a few days ago (and no I havent watched scary movies or anything). Any advice?"
517,Klonopin 0.5 mg daily for 21 months,Anxiety,"I have been taking klonopin since february of 2019. I was prescribed to it shortly after my mother passed away. I had incredible panic attacks and severe anxiety, that left me short of breath and absolutley manic for a while. The klonopin has defintitley helped me a great deal. I will go as far to say that it has even saved my life. My question is, with the dose that I have been taking, and the duration I have been taking it, If I were to stop using it, would there be a severe withdrawl? I know I should probably consult my doctor and of course taper off, but I figured it wouldnt hurt to jump on here and ask."
518,Severe Panic Attack-like Symptoms 24/7,Anxiety,"Hi guys, so I had a panic attack a few days ago, and since I had the panic attack I feel absolutely horrible 24/7, I feel like i'm going in and out of consciousness sometimes, and I just have this horrible feeling throughout my body, mainly in my head and my vision, everything is so fuzzy, it feels like I'm totally not present and I'm just stuck in this state of suffering, kind of feels like I'm going to lose consciousness at any moment, and I randomly start sweating and feeling really hot at random times, I am still conscious obviously but I feel stuck in this state of feeling extremely sick and horrible and it's not getting better, it's been so bad I've felt like I needed to go to the hospital but they will probably just send me home, I have an anti-anxiety medication benzo, all it does is makes me stop crying, it doesn't actually help any of these symptoms to improve - can this really all just be anxiety and panic because it feels like the worst thing I've ever felt in my life nonstop the past few days, when I tried to go outside and walk it just felt like I was going to collapse, and it's so hard for me to even be able to watch a movie or play video games

 it doesn't seem to be improving and I am very distressed because of this, I am really concerned that something is happen to me in terms of actual physical health and that this is never going to get better only worse, has anyone else had this and how can I get through this"
519,A lack of self-compassion worsens panic and anxiety.,Anxiety,"My health anxiety screams at me, “You and your family could contract a disease and die.” Which although not the most likely, because we’re all under 60, isn’t 100% irrational in this day and age.

But for me with the self-talk that really gets me spiraling is an undertone of, “... because you will have f’d it up, you big dummy!”

That 2nd part is really responsible for 55% of the misery that my panic/anxiety causes me.

Let’s imagine you have a good friend who’s suffered some misfortune, would you allow them to blame, berate and punish themselves without saying a word? 

You deserve to treat yourself at least as kindly as you would a friend. I’ve been trying to apply this lately and have felt a great improvement."
520,Does this help anyone else?,Anxiety,When I'm out and about and I start getting anxiety something that snaps me out of my thoughts is opening my eyes wide. It's like I see more of what's infront of me and I can focus on what's going on infront of me and not my head.
522,Someone please help,Anxiety,"Ok so I’ve had intrusive thoughts before and I get this feeling now like it’s like a intrusive thought pops up in my head, but there’s no thought. It’s like there’s nothing but my head keeps getting my attention with no thoughts. I can’t even explain how I feel and it makes me think I’m going crazy or something. :( I can’t even put into words what I feel ugh it’s so hard"
523,If that can make you feel better,Anxiety,"Most people who suffer from anxiety are of very high consciousness, even Nikola Tesla was having anxiety. 
    
Dr. Hawkins (Nobel Price winner) explained well The Levels Of Consciousness.
    
Do you consider your-self as having a higher level of consciousness than most people around you?"
524,"Any time I feel any symptom at all, I start getting scared and anxious and psychosomatic about coronavirus. It's so stressful.",Anxiety,"I have two kids, one isn't a year old yet, I'm already stressed with that and virtual school. It makes sense that I'll get a headache, or maybe a post nasal drip after a poor sleep (which is every night since he still isn't sleeping through the night). Or a morning cough from the weather changing to drier air. Or fatigue because it is exhausting these days.

But any time, I get that whole-body response of what feels like a chill that drops top to bottom and is through my veins. My stomach turns, my breathing gets shallow, my ears burn, my face is hot, and my rumination is nuts. I've already been tested twice because I was freaking out about a tickle in my throat or a headache and fatigue that felt abnormal and a 99 fever that only lasted a day. Negative both times.

When I feel the anxiety coming, I try to calm myself, maybe take a hot shower. It's just terrifying. We wear masks, we stay at home, grocery shop at night. We go on trails for hikes or walks in the woods or biking, but always make way for people. But I keep thinking ""oh my god, what if what if?"" And then think about the kids and my husband and everything. It's so hard to remember that there are regular cold symptoms, or people get things sometimes.

Tonight I took a bite of some butter toast and felt like it was a little bland. Immediately freaked out inside and went to smell things and taste cranberries and coffee. ""Okay, I can smell and taste-- but is it more muted than usual?"" Ugh. I was already an anxious person, prone to negative thought patterns. 

I guess I'm just venting. It's hard right now, a that's coming from the privileged position of still having income and our health."
525,Book suggestions?,Anxiety,"Asking for a friend. I’m reading through a good ADHD book, it made my friend jealous, and now she wants one for her anxiety. Any good ideas?"
526,Does anybody else invalidate what they feel?,Anxiety,"Sometimes I feel I'm just being overdramatic. When anxiety fades and I feel relatively fine, looking back, it doesn't feel real anymore. It feels as though anxiety never happened to me, but when it comes back, these intense feelings return as well. On days that I feel better, anxiety is alien to me, but when it does come, only then it'll feel real. Then, the cycle never ends."
527,Social anxiety goes away at conventions and concerts?,Anxiety,"So I am talking to my friends about how much I love and miss comic, anime, and furry conventions and concerts and it got me thinking. I have really bad social anxiety in the everyday. Shopping makes me nervous as does going to work. Going out in general can, but when I go to a concert/festival or a convention, it’s not that bad. Like I feel more comfortable if that makes since. Like yes I still experience anxiety but not to the point I do in normal situations. Is anyone else like this? Can anyone explain why? I still get very drained after events like this but still."
528,What am I meant to do?,Anxiety,"I always make something bigger than it is then I will stress out about it and it usually ends in sitting on the floor crying. Today I was meant to go to the pool with a friends but one of them pulled out. I felt awkward going with this one girl so I asked if she had anyone else to go with. I sent her multiple messages letting her know I won’t come, then if her friends are going to keep her company then maybe I will go then never mind I won’t go. 
She didn’t respond so I got really worked up and cried. 

What can I do to stop getting so worked up and worried about such small things?

Thanks"
529,I feel anxious about the future,Anxiety,"Some people might think this is very ridiculous especially when I 27 year old, but I personally feel anxiety about the future. I feel anxious because of the pandemic. 
Anyone that have any tips on how to reduce the anxiety?"
530,Cruel world,Anxiety,"I don't know if I have black-tinted glasses or if the entire world is actually shit, because sometimes it seems like everything is terrible and a total mess, so fucking sick of it, daily anxiety for just being alive is actually dreadful."
531,Can’t make this phone call,Anxiety,"Ok, quite weird situation.

I’ve had experienced anxiety and depression 5 years ago, seen a therapist, been prescribed Lexapro for a couple months and it went good.

Recently, I have a friend who experienced a major depression but also strong symptoms such as hearing bad voices telling him to hurt himself and his surrounding.
I couldn’t help but identify myself to him, and now I only have one fear : to become like him, hear voices, lose control, become crazy.

I had some ups and downs these past few weeks but cannot completely blow this irrational fear away.

Yet I am completely unable to call a therapist, telling myself that it is nothing and I can heal by myself, yet I know I probably cannot.

Any tips to help me pick my damn phone up and book an appointment ?"
532,Whats the best way to overcome?,Anxiety,"Basically I get anxious, my heart starts beating fast and then I start breathing faster which makes it nervous and the fact my heart is beating fast makes me even more nervous. How do I stop all this?"
533,I think my anxiety is making me physically ill,Anxiety,"my (17F) anxiety recently has been the worst it’s ever been. for days now it’s so bad that i can’t eat or sleep or focus on things outside of my intrusive thoughts. For days i can’t eat and when i do eat and i stand up i vomit repeatedly or get very dizzy and need to sit down. my body shakes and hurts and is weak. this has been happening for a few days now and im 90% sure it’s because of my anxiety? after i throw up i have a small panic attack and cry and cry until i eventually calm down enough to get off the floor and go lay down on my bed. what can i do.. i can’t see any doctors or therapists since covid, all appointments are months later. nothing seems to be helping i feel fragile and weak and i’m pretty sure my family doesn’t understand that crippling anxiety can make you sick. i’ve had anxiety for most of my life but it has Never been THIS crippling before. my family and friends and teachers are not going to understand."
534,Feeling dismissed,Anxiety,"I've been having a tough time with anxiety lately. I started having panic attacks in October and since then I've had daily issues with breathing, fear/panic, tension headaches and sleeping. I'm gradually getting better but my mood is generally low and I really don't have much energy to give to others right now. I seem to get easily frustrated and angry at the smallest things. 

One thing I've found frustrating when trying to talk to people about this is when I'm told that ""well, these are difficult times, everyone's anxious right now"" and ""we're all in the same boat"" or even worse ""at least you've not been laid off"" (so that I then feel guilty for even mentioning feeling bad). I don't know about other people, but this rubs me the wrong way because it makes me feel like the way I feel is dismissed. I had a counselor tell me this, friends and parents. I feel mean complaining about it, because I think they are trying to be reassuring, but it makes me feel sort of irrelevant. ""Everyone feels the same way, you're no different, so stop complaining about it"" is how I'm interpreting this response. It also sort of shuts down the conversation. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just being horribly oversensitive? I am, aren't I?"
535,Hypochondria after losing my Grandpa,Anxiety,"Has anyone else been worries about dying from cancer or something after losing a loved one? I am a young adult so I know the odds are in my favor but I worry about everything and you never know. I got an EKG and a abdominal ultrasound and everything is good. I have had lots of stomach problems and stuff but I think it is caused by the immense depression and anxiety I am, almost, always under. I am going to the GI doctor in a few weeks and I am sure he will say I am fine but I just really would like to hear that instead of guess that, you know? Anyways, the doctors think I am fine but I don't. I was never like this and had no problems before losing my Grandpa but then, after I lost him, BOOM problems left and right. Chest pain. Heartburn. Indigestion. Diarrhea. All that. But most of all, stress and anxiety. COVID has only made it worse because I get bored a lot. What should I do? I randomly get a since of impending death from the anxiety and I know that is normal but the pain I have felt is not anything like I ever imagining losing someone is like. If anyone else has felt this, please share your story and how you cope. Some days are better then others but as I said, I think I will feel a lot better after I go to my GI doctor just to be sure and get out of this semester so I can relax."
536,How do I submit a two weeks notice?,Anxiety,"I know it's different for every job, mine requires it in writing. I'm job hunting and can expect to have to submit it soon in the future. This is my first job so obv I've never done it before. Realistically i know its easy but I'm stressing bc that involves talking to people. 

Can yall pls explain it in detail so I feel a bit better?"
537,Ever feel like your friends and loved ones will abandon you?,Anxiety,"2020 has been an awful year for everyone and I am no acceptation. My anxiety has shot through the roof this year and its not really due to the pandemic, its more due to my friends abandoning me. 

There was an incident earlier in the year that, suffice rocked me to my core, and has put a lot of relationships on edge. They are slowly starting to come back together, but I am still struggling with something they said to me. Basically, ""We need to decide if we are still going to be friends with you or not."" I am keeping it intentionally vague because Its still really hard for me to talk about. 

But that has been something that has stuck with me for all these months. I am used to being in regular contact with my friends, it helps me feel reassured that I am important to them and they still care about me.

But it's hard when they wont write me back or reach out to me on their own. My rational brain keeps telling me that they're busy and not ignoring you, which I honestly struggle to believe. That has been something I am dealing with for most of the day, but its been very hard for me to keep myself even a little calm. 

I know this might need to go under the rant flair, but what I mainly need is some support I think.

538,"I have spent over $2000 in the last year on doctor visits, in the last year, and I'm still not over my Health Anxiety",Anxiety,"I'm currently sitting in my living room shaking. I told my poor gf that I just wanted to play some xbox a little later, but instead I'm shaking in fear that I'm going to die. Or even worse, that I have cancer and will end up killing myself from the anxiety.

I am literally the boy who cried wolf. It doesn't help that I'm fair skinned and have moles everywhere. I don't go in the sun without sunblock, it's quarantine and I'm a basement dweller. Among my seemingly 100 moles, which honestly look just like bigger freckles, I have several that look ""suspicious"". Everyone tells me not to worry, but I haven't been to the doctor for it yet. I realized that all of the tests for it can cost up to another few hundred dollars. I'm\[20/M\] literally broke now because of my anxiety.

Reddit, what am I supposed to do? Wait and never go, or try to get to the bottom of it. All of the waiting without any results is going to kill me. I'm terrified, yet I just keep caving in. I'm sorry. I'm just lost. The last thing I want, is to gamble with my life, but should I even be worrying about the gamble?"
539,Just wanted to know if anyone out there feels the same,Anxiety,"Hi guys! I’ve had anxiety for about 4 years now. At first, it was your typical health anxiety. I would freak out convincing myself I have whatever disease at that moment. It then all subsided for 2 years ( I was away at college) I feel like I was just too focused on school and living my life to even think about anxiety. Fast forward, this past February I started experiencing weird anxiety. It started with a 2 week period of extreme fogginess, heart palpitations, panic, no appetite, diarrhea, etc. it would come and go for months. This past august, I decided to switch my medication to Zoloft. I just feel like the past 8 months my anxiety is me saying to myself “I feel off” or “I feel weird” just not like myself? Not clear? It’s so hard to describe. I know what I’m doing, what I’m seeing, but just feels off? And of course this makes me spiral into an anxiety cycle. I’ve been trying to force myself to tell myself I feel good when I feel off. Lol. I just don’t even know what to do and I guess just wanted to know I’m not alone"

542,"letting my anxiety control my life is so unrealistic and I don't think I can do it anymore, but it's so exhausting",Anxiety,"It's not like my anxiety is suddenly going away, it's probably worse than ever, but it's gotten to the point where I avoid working if I can because my job gives me anxiety, and I actually can't afford to do that anymore. I also avoid my schoolwork because of the anxiety it gives me, and that doesn't fly in college. It's still there but I'm trying to learn to just tell it no and move on, at least in regards to those things, because I have to do those no matter what. I just wish I didn't have anxiety about these things  in the first place, normal activities are just so much more exhausting having to fight myself all the way through. I can barely get myself to ask for a promotion at work that I'm 99% sure I'm going to get for quite a few reasons, simply because I'm too scared to go in and ask, but I need the money. It took all of my energy to get through the semester and even change my major, and I wasn't even trying hard enough and had to drop a class just to get a decent enough GPA. But whats worse is that I know I have what it takes. I know I'm smart and I know I can work hard, I just feel like I'm not and that I can't. I have to stop being anxious about these things in order to live but I can't and it's just so incredibly frustrating, especially because people don't understand the anxiety I have about these things. They think it's so easy to just pick up an extra shift or buckle down and do my work, and I know it should be but it's not and I just can't deal with it anymore. but I have to because that's life, and I'm really trying to change my mindset and get things done.

544,How to deal with over-talking,Anxiety,"I have social anxiety and as much as I have a hard time socializing and don’t always like talking, I also sometimes can’t stop myself from word vomit, particularly when already a little anxious. Then talking too much makes me more nervous, and so I anxiously ramble more. Sometimes I’ll unintentionally overshare and wish I hadn’t said nearly as much as I just did. Anybody else deal with this? Any tips on managing it?"
545,"Constant Anxiety, could use your pointers.",Anxiety,"I recently experienced a horrible episode of anxiety that has been with me for a week. At the beginning of the pandemic it hit me good but I beat it. I even had an ulcer while that happened and I made it. All summer I was doing great and now, it’s back and harder.

I got spooked by the news and started to lose weight from the stress. I didn’t lose too much but enough to make me concerned. I did see my doctor and talked with my therapist. I did blood work on Weds, and now awaiting results. My only fear is waiting for that and I haven’t been sleeping as good. I used to smoke pot during the day relax and at night to sleep. I feel like the quitting of that has made it hard to sleep and now I’ve been waking up at 5am almost every day since Monday because of this. Just in a sheer panic, shaking body, and I have been using headspace to calm down. Typically it works but today I am just a shaking mess. 

The added low sleep and trying to eat more to get myself back up to my weight has felt like an uphill battle.

My biggest fear is my body and I hate feeling my heartbeat in my chest. I have a wrist cuff to check my blood pressure and it says normal all the time unless my panic really hits hard.

I feel at a loss but posting here for some tips or your recovery stories. I don’t take meds because I’m afraid of them but I really try to focus on the meditations and distractions. 

I hope I can overcome this soon."
546,road test anxiety,Anxiety,"i’m using voice to text so ignore any typos. I’m taking my road test tomorrow morning after dying to get it for five years. I come from a very poor background and wasn’t able to afford drivers Ed, a car, or insurance in high school and I finally was able to pay for lessons at 20 years old and tomorrow is the day that I likely fuck up and throw away all that time and money. I feel like I’m already at a disadvantage because I didn’t have parents to teach me how to drive and i’ve only really had 20 hours of drive time. if I fail I’m truly fucked because I just got a job out of walking distance from me and next year I work a full-time internship a half hour away. I am panicking so much. I always fuck up on the smallest little things and I’m terrified."
547,Should I go to sleep?,Anxiety,"My mom took my dad to the hospital cause he wasn’t feeling well, and I’m not even worried about my dad cause he’s an asshole, but I do worry about my mom cause I’m super dependent on her and can’t do anything without her, but It’s half past midnight and I woke up at 5:30 am today for a blood test, so I am really tired, but I’m afraid that if I go to sleep then something bad is going to happen and I’ll be asleep"
548,Certain people give me anxiety,Anxiety,How do I deal with this? It’s a parent btw. I just feel so criticized and judged even though I know I’m not being purposely criticized and I just cry. I’m not going to explain the situation. In simple terms: I just don’t want everyone that I know to know that I have a talent because I don’t want that attention because I know I will get worked up about it and people will talk about me. It might be good talk but I don’t want to be the subject of my parents conversation as a bragging topic or whatever. And I know they have been talking about it. I’m not making it up. I told this parent they are really judgmental and they worked on it for a while and now this situation happens and they totally cross a line. Yeah I understand that they are proud of me but still. Help. Maybe you have another perspective?
549,Does anyone else open up like this?,Anxiety,"Okay, so I have a hard time being vulnerable with people, even people I think i trust. Whenever I’m thinking of telling someone something deep, I usually get stuck in a mental tug-of-war between “I should open up because were really close” and “I’ve not ever opened up so we must not be that close” and end up not telling them out of stress. I was thinking and realized that sometimes I do open up, just not the way a lot of people do. (Or maybe they do. That’s why I’m here.)

I have a couple of very specific topics I know too much about and can infodump about at any given time. Whenever I’m close to someone, rather than talking about my life, I end up going on huge passionate explanations about everything I know. I think it’s sometimes overwhelming since I’m very quiet, which doesn’t help with the nervousness. But I guess I just feel safer around people that I can tell those things to. If I know they’ll be okay with an almost completely unprompted rant about a particular trope in literature, I know they’ll be okay with anything else I might tell them. But I feel like I’m the only one that does that. None of my friends talk about their favorite things in that context."
550,Xanax and lyrica,Anxiety,"hi guys i really need help

which made me addicted to xanax and lyrica especially

so i can escape the thoughts

but im tired of this addiction

i want to get better

551,I failed :),Anxiety,"I failed an exam, bad. I got around 20% in an exam and I dont know what to do. This is my lowest ever by far. I feel like such a disappointment to my family, I know I am, they're so mad at me and I feel so bad about it. My hands are shaking as I write this, I dont know what to do."
552,Need encouragement to face anxiety,Anxiety,"Edit: already in therapy and on meds; tried many of both. Looking for advice besides that

I’ve struggled with severe anxiety for 10+ years, mainly panic attacks when alone. 

It interferes a ton with my life because I always have to be near people and can’t drive too far from civilization. 

When I panic the worst, I totally lose the ability to think clearly, go on autopilot and run to find people, and generally feel out of control/hysterical/absolutely panic stricken and it lasts until I reach people—so I’m terrified of that happening when I am truly out of reach of others (rural areas, etc) because I don’t know when/if I’d ever calm down. 

Please share if you’ve had similar issues/how you dealt with them—considering doing a small “flooding” exercise because I can’t bear to deal with this anymore."
553,I need some help getting on board with my new medication,Anxiety,"I've had what i can only assume is anxiety for a while now, and I recently talked to my doctor about medication. She prescribed me zoloft and after a few days I started to have the worst experience of my life. my skin was on fire, my body felt like I was touching a power line, I couldn't think, I was panicking more often then not, and I was away from home the whole time so I didn't have anything to ground me. I stopped taking it but even several weeks later my anxiety is still significantly worse than it was when I started and im mortified it'll never go back down. I got prescribed a new medication, venlafaxine, but im still really scared to take it. I've also been coping with a phobia of substances or intoxication or whatever. It took everything I had to have half a beer at Thanksgiving. That fear is largely from my experience with zoloft and obviously it is seriously inhibiting me from taking this new medication. Do you think I should take it, or spend some more time trying to get my mental health abit more under control before moving forward. Again though its already been several weeks, and quarantine isn't making anything any better. Thank you in advance, this is my first time posting in this sub."
554,burping,Anxiety,"I find myself burping a bunch with anxiety, especially when it’s intense. It alleviates the nausea I feel. Does anyone else find themselves doing this??"
555,Death,Anxiety,I have this weird relation with death. Every time I see someone or think about someone my anxiety says they are going to die unless I do something. I know its anxiety but it scares me a lot. I can't even talk to anyone without thinking their going to die. I also can't do anything because my anxiety tells me if I do something then their going to die. Like imagine I do x then x is going to die. It's so annoying and I know its not true. Any advice because it's really freaking me out.
556,DAE get anxiety while eating?,Anxiety,"Essentially, the title. I find my anxiety spiking when I eat a meal. Not sure of it's the act of eating that scares me, a blood sugar spike that presents as anxiety, or a physical sensation (digestion, etc) that manifests that way. 

Anyone else deal with this and find any tips to help? Strangely, distraction while eating helps me some (TV, playing a phone game). 

I'm not sure what's causing it. It started randomly around when quarantine in the US started."
557,I dont know if I should go to a therapist,Anxiety,I've been having depression and anxiety since I was in college and its not getting better I always used to think I'll be able to manage and this is all in my head and I can move on but it just keeps getting worse and now all I have are dark uneasy thoughts I dont know if I should exist kinda thoughts..I cant sleep either I try to and my mind wanders and I have to watch porn just to get tired and doze off..
558,I feel anxious 24/7,Anxiety,"Hi, I was just wondering if anyone could help with my anxiety problem.

I have had anxiety for as long as I can’t remember, i think it got worse around 15/16 (I’m 26 nowI feel anxious all the time, 24/7 even in ‘normal’ circumstances. I can be at home watching tv feeling anxious for no reason. I couldn’t say what I feel anxious about, it’s seemingly for no reason, just like a switch that is constantly on. I think I may have a generalised anxiety problem, however, it is worse in social situations. But it’s still all the time I feel anxious, regardless of situation.

I finally recently got medication to try and help. I was prescribed sertraline (Zoloft) 50mg 8 weeks ago and then moved onto 100mg. I think it has helped my low mood but sadly not anything for my anxiety.

I am looking for some advice on what to do and hear about other people’s experiences.
Do any of you feel constantly anxious?

Thank you"
559,Anyone get anxious to go to sleep??,Anxiety,Almost as if your mind believes that your dying so it jolts you back up!
560,I’m crippled by my anxiety and seeking advice on treatment options outside of doctor prescribed prescriptions,Anxiety,"I’m a 19 year old who’s had trouble with,and been treated for anxiety among other things.Despite my other foibles,anxiety seems to be my primary problem these days.I’m finally finishing high school (a couple years late) and soon I’ll be expected to to get a job and get going with my life;the problem is my anxiety prevents all of this.At the state I’m in right now,I don’t see myself ever getting started with life,and I fear that I’ll either become a leach on my parents or I’ll cave under everything and decide to jump ship on this life.I don’t want this to be how my life works out,and it kills me to imagine my parents losing another son,but I can’t help but feel this hopeless in the face of my anxiety.I know doctor prescribed medications MAY be the best option and maybe I’ll cave and take this route again eventually,but right now I’d greatly appreciate any advice people can give on alternative ways that they’ve taken this on.I don’t expect a quick fix,I know that no matter what route I take it’ll require work,but I’m prepared to do that work if it means I start making real progress,thanks in advance."
561,Things look weird,Anxiety,Hello guys! Its very late and i went to brush my teeth. I looked out the Window and i stared at one light lamp thing and after few seconds it looked like its moving a bit like its unstable and it made me get anxious its worse cuz im boutta go to sleep and my anxiety is the worst before sleep.Is This a common anxiety symptom?
562,A ton of work got deleted and my parents wont let me leave so I can have space,Anxiety,Ok so music applications for college are due on the 30th and I am applying to be a composition major at a couple of different places. I have spent weeks working on an acapella to the words of The Kraken by Tennison and tonight I noticed that 4 measures of work are gone(4 really important measures) and I am in the middle of a bit of a panic attack cuz I can't recreate it or undo the deletion and I need to leave because I have been stuck in my house for so long but my parents are scared that if I do I am going to hurt myself but I have no plans to. I just really need to just not be in the house. I don't know what to do and I really need to be somewhere that isn't here
563,Anyone that used medication for anxiety have side effects?,Anxiety,Do you have side effects and did they go away or were they long lasting side effects? Did you need to change medication because of these side effects? What treatment did you use for side effects like Acid Reflux or diarrhea?
564,I’m already a failure,Anxiety,"So at thanksgiving everyone was talking about business and computer science and how so many people they know started companies

I’m studying business but I don’t know if I’ll be good enough to start a company. I feel worthless and that I’m just wasting my money in college if I won’t be able to do great things like starting my own company. 

Is it okay to have just an average job?"
565,i’ve been having serious anxiety attacks for the past few days.,Anxiety,"i don’t know what exactly is triggering me to start panicking and feel like i’m going to die of a heart attack. the first thing that comes to mind is my ex. we broke up a few months ago after two years together. when we broke up, i had a mental breakdown and had to go see a psychiatrist and now i’m medicated. it’s helped but effexor takes forever to kick in. i’m on klonopin and propranolol as well. 

ever since the breakup, he’s told me twice he would send my clothes back. it’s been two months. and i don’t want to talk to him because the thought of even hearing him or seeing a response freaks me the hell out and sends me into another dimension of anxiety and despair. 

but the past few days, i’ve constantly been shaking. my hands never stop trembling. my heart feels like it’s going to burst. i’ve been terrified to sleep, i haven’t slept much, maybe 2-3 hours a day. my psychiatrist also prescribed me sleeping pills because i would have panic attacks in my sleep and dissociate shortly after. IM PRETTY MUCH A HOT MESS. 

so i’m writing this after i just had an episode of i don’t even know what it was but i definitely was not present on this planet. i can’t even remember what happened. i just know i’m full of anxiety and it’s infuriating me to no end. i think i just need to talk to someone who has similar issues because i just want to get some stuff off my chest. and i’ll listen to you vent if you want!"
566,"Girlfriend had a job shadow today, they didn’t offer job on the spot. Said they would contact in a few days. She is anxious and scared",Anxiety,"My girlfriend was laid off for covid and has been searching for a job for about 3 months. She’s been trying so hard and as an introvert with anxiety it’s been very taxing on her. Anyway today she had a job shadow at a vet clinic. She was hoping they’d offer her the job today before she left but they said they’d been in touch in a few days. Which I find to be normal. But she is discouraged and anxious that it means she won’t be offered the job. She’s extremely qualified and the job shadow went great today. I think her hopes were up to get the offer on the spot and her anxiety is running out of control a bit that this means she won’t be getting the job. 
Can you guys say some things to reassure her that it doesn’t mean she isn’t getting the job? 
Her anxiety has focused in on this and made it hard for her to focus on anything else. 
Any kind words of hope and inspiration would be appreciated. Maybe some reassurance that it’s normal for a few days wait after a job shadow. Thank you everyone!"
567,What do people think about when they don't worry?,Anxiety,"My mind repeats the same worries over and over. Each worry is like a stone that I must touch over and over again. When I try to stop the worrying, I don't know what to think about anymore. What do people think about when they don't worry?"
568,Repressed Emotions,Anxiety,"You can't feel anything no matter what you're facing.

You are always stuck in a certain type of emotion ( rage , hate , fear ... ) 

You experience several body illnesses and the doctors tell you nothing is wrong with you.

You stuck in your head thinking all the time getting, obsessed with the simplest things. 

You're always assuming the worst things.

Having insomnia or even if you sleep you have nightmares or the same bad dream.

Your relationships follow a certain rythme Always getting the same problem with people. 

That means there's a fixation on bad Traumatic experiences you had in your past .. your unsuccessful repressed emotions keep you stuck .."
569,"I just had a mild panic attack (or anxiety attack, unsure)",Anxiety,"I stupidly locked the bathroom door, and my dad got mad. Like, really mad. I tried to open the thing myself, but couldn't. My dad called the locksmith. I was embarrassed, so I sat in the corner flooding my head with thoughts such as: 'dummy.' 'not worth it'. So, I texted my mom and told her I was scared. I texted her about 10 times before she responded. We talked, and I was hyperventilating, sweating, felt like I was choking, felt suicidal, etc. My dad shouted at me for crying, even though my body was telling me to respond to my intense emotion. I felt alert and defenseless. This happened about an hour ago, and went to Reddit to try to get some weight off my shoulders for help."
570,"I Need Non-Martial Artists (ages 18-65). The Impact of Martial Arts on Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Anger, Wellbeing, Self-Transcendence, and Self-Enhancement Survey",Anxiety,"I am conducting a research study in order to complete my doctoral degree on the benefits of martial arts in areas of depression, anxiety, stress, anger, wellbeing, and connecting it to qualities of self-transcendence and self-enhancement. I need not only martial artists but need non-martial artists as well.

I hope my research will provide further knowledge within the mental health field and show that martial arts can be an effective tool to cope with various symptoms. Although the internet has discussed its benefits, most websites base their facts on assumptions with no evidence or substantial reference. To support this, I am conducting research to hopefully fill the void and provide the support needed to show how martial arts is more than fighting, but about helping one’s state of mind.

I need people who do martial arts at any level and people who do not do martial arts, between the ages of 18-65. My goal is to gather data from 50 martial artists and 50 non-martial artists. The study will be completed entirely online through a survey and will take approximately 10 minutes.

There are minimal risks to this study, only that it may cause awkwardness and discomfort. However, all information will be anonymous, and no identifying information will be asked from you.

Your participation will do wonderful benefits to the martial arts and mental health community.

This research will be conducted by Joseph Kaufmann an Applied Clinical Psychology Student at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles.

571,Feeling anxious and depressed,Anxiety,Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m not enough and I’m not worth anything. I live with my boyfriend and everything is well... except I’m currently not working. It’s been hard trying to find a job when I don’t have a way for transportation and I am extremely anxious about possibly getting COVID. I get really sad when I catch my boyfriend say that something is his. Like his apartment or something else is his. My name is on the lease too but I don’t feel like it’s mine. Especially since he pays for most things. I only help out when I can. I have an Etsy store online and that’s my income for now. I guess sometimes I feel really anxious knowing that I don’t have much even though he says it’s “ours” buttt sometimes he says it’s just his. Sorry if it’s confusing. Not really sure how to explain it. I just feel really worthless and like I don’t have anything. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Please help.

575,Struggling with a mistake I made,Anxiety,"First of all, I'm not entirely sure if this is an appropriate subreddit for this, but mostly I'm after some emotional support and reassurance and I'm not too well-versed with other parts of Reddit.

Basically, several months ago I accidently purchased a membership to eHarmony whilst feeling lonely and having a particularly depressive episode. eHarmony doesn't clearly list their prices on the membership page, so I attempted to locate the cost by connecting my PayPal, under the impression that it would confirm a price before payment (Rookie mistake, I know). Much to my surprise, the website immediately withdrew a payment from me without asking for price confirmation.

In an attempt to rectify my mistake, I hastily attempted to cancel my membership and emailed customer support explaining that it was a mistake. Sadly, they were less than understanding and began demanding monthly instalments from me - explaining that I had 'agreed in the terms &amp; conditions to pay increasingly large monthly fees for the next two years.'

Struggling with an anxiety disorder already, I began panicking and becoming extremely upset about my error, in addition the predatory and unforgiving nature of the company.

Removing my payment information from my account was met with formal emails from the company threatening possible legal action if I refuse to pay. Now I'm completely freaking out about the nature of this 'legal action'.

This situation is extremely difficult for me and I'm not sure how to deal with this company. I feel like I'm being picked apart by vultures and it's weighing on me so heavily."
576,Help! I'm afraid of being canceled for my past!,Anxiety,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I have a fear of being harassed, doxed, and canceled. I was always told to ""get over it"", but I couldn't. I tried finding something to do to distract myself (I now like making beats), but I was always constantly afraid whenever I thought of being canceled.

so when I was 13, I was always acting like a dick (I'm 14 now and I realized these mistakes). I commented some racist stuff out of anger (My mix of autism and ADHD could play a big factor in that) and I was always trying to do anything to fit in and 'be cool' by saying slurs that I didn't know meanings to. When I was 14, I cringed at myself for these types of things that I did. I'm afraid of having my life ruined by other pages on Instagram if you search ""exposing racists"" you will find plenty of them, which exposes kids and teens for irresponsible stuff (and mostly dox these teens, what school they go to, and their phone number, and in rare times, their home address). These pages also encourage people to harass the teens. I'm still stressing out and having anxiety to this day and I'm constantly procrastinating.

How do I get rid of this fear?"

578,Chronic anxiety but a moment of clarity?,Anxiety,"I’ve had what feels like nonstop panic attacks for 5 days straight - and out of nowhere, feeling just nothing. Like the feeling you get when you haven’t eaten in a while, suddenly have food, and then your mind and body feel sleepy from the spike in blood pressure. Maybe I’ve exhausted my mind to the point that my body is forcing itself to pause out of shock. Anyone ever experience this with chronic anxiety?"

580,Nose bleed,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, so I just had a nosebleed and my head has been hurting really bad for awhile now and I’m just really scared that it is something more serious since I got a nose bleed because I never get nose bleeds have not gotten one in years."
581,How does anyone write assignments?,Anxiety,"How can anyone write assignments without sitting there panicking that whatever you do will never be good enough? How is it possible to just sit there with a clear mind and write it? I will never understand this. I have two assignments due in the next four weeks and I spend half my time staring, thinking they are nowhere near as good as anyone else's work. I panic about what my family will think, and how they'll react if I don't do well or if I drop out entirely. I panic about how the lecturers will judge what I do, and think I'm an idiot. I worry about how my future job prospects will be affected if I do badly. I worry so much that I can never get a thing done"
582,Just venting about my hypochondria.,Anxiety,"Perhaps no one will read this, I just felt like writing a bit.

There are a lot of different anxieties and mine mainly is hypochondria. For the people that do not know what this is; it basically means you are afraid to die because of some illness, cancer, ALS or whatever other disease you can come up with.

My main anxiety is and always has been a heart attack, ever since I got diagnosed with an anxiety/panic disorder 5 years ago.

It developed after a period of a lot of stress. Career-wise, financially but what messed me up the most was my then girlfriend of 6 years cheating on me.

I went through a few months of constantly thinking I was going to die in one way or another. I almost couldn't sleep, I was afraid to get a heart-attack in the shower and no one would find me. The panic attacks ofcourse were the worst but even when I calmed down my body kept being stressed and afraid.

It went to a point where I was afraid of taking the bus, being out in public, watching a movie in the cinema or even elevators. While watching a movie in the cinema (I was seeing a girl at the time), I looked where the exits were and basically didn't watch anything of the movie because i was so anxious all the time.

I decided to go to group therapy which luckily helped me quite a lot. I was told to do the things I was scared of. So eventually I did. I drank some redbull and started running around the neighbourhood to see if I would die of a heart attack.

PS: Don't use any medicines. Used Prozac for a month or two but some 'part' of me didn't work really well so I quit.

Eventually after a few months I got control of my mind and haven't got a real panic attack ever since. Still, my anxiety never went away.

This Hypochondria..... it sounds like some mythical beast I have to slay. Every few months it seems to randomise it's attack. Some months it hits me with being nauseous all the time. After he's done with that he will attack me with twitching body parts so it makes me think I have ALS. Then Some weeks of diarrhea or dizzyness.

Ofcourse the worst periods are the ones with pains in my higher abdomen or pains near my chest. Even though I know a heart disease probably would feel different, It still scares me.

This ofcourse takes a huge toll on your stress levels, especially if other things in life are not going that well either.

Right now I'm having these chest pains again but I still think that one day, If I ever get my life back on track, most of my anxiety problems will always go. I will beat this disorder and so can you."
583,How do you remind yourself that you’re not as big in other people minds as you are yours?,Anxiety,"I had a therapist once that told me when I’m ruminating or worrying about something I said/did, that I should remember I’m probably overthinking and the other person probably doesn’t remember/care as much as I think they do.

It’s this idea that we’re the star of our own shows, and usually don’t carry as much weight in other people’s minds.

I tell myself this, but does anyone have any tips/tricks for cementing this idea in your mind?"
584,Can't stop hitting myself and other things!,Anxiety,"Hi all

I've made a throw away for this just in case. Sorry for any bad formatting but I'm on mobile. 

I haven't had a panic attack for a long time but had one tonight for some reason. I think it's been building for a while because for the past few weeks I've been feeling a bit out of it (like I'm watching myself for a distance), and stammering when I talk. 

So tonight I had a total meltdown over something ridiculous. Once the initial panting, dizziness , and racing pulse had gone, I started struggling to get me words out and stammering really badly. Now, this is usual and passes pretty fast usually but for some reason, just when I thought it was getting better, I slapped myself in the face really hard! This happened about three times and then I managed to stop myself by slapping the furniture instead. It seems to have stopped now but does any one have any idea why I would have done this? Like I said, this was the first time in a long time so it makes sense it would maybe be bad but I've never got violent before! 

Any thoughts would be appreciated."

But this is my first home. It’s a lot of money out the window in what seems like the craziest time in history.. what if **deflation** or **devaluation** occur with Biden policies? What if the housing market crashes and I bought high? 

I’m a sole provider for my wife and unborn son (due April). We’re 30 and this is our first home. Debt free. I feel like I’ve made all the right moves to prepare for this moment but I can’t help feeling like I’m making a giant mistake given the times. Any advice??"
586,How do I stop cringing at myself?,Anxiety,"Does anybody have any tricks on how to stop constantly thinking about embarrassing things from your past? Like stupid things you've done, or something dumb you said? It's gotten to the point now where I literally have to tell myself out loud to shut up. I get the vibe that people don't want to be around me because of how cringey and annoying I am."
587,I don't know how to show people that I like them,Anxiety,I recently met someone online and I really like them but I'm getting more and more anxious that I will fuck it up like I did before. Like how do you even tell someone that you like them?
588,I wasn't myself today and I feel like I ruined everything,Anxiety,"My anxiety is messing me up today and I feel like I ruined everything. Tonight I hung out with a group of friends. Normally I feel really comfortable in this group and can just be myself. Anxiety, for some reason, decided to take that away from me today. I felt anxious and awkward the whole time. I was shy and quiet, and kept thinking I was annoying and that everybody hated me. I couldn't stop the negative thoughts and it made me really stiff and weird. I wasn't myself. I really, really hope no-one noticed it. I'm so happy we have new things planned because if there were no new plans I'd honestly think people would ghost me after tonight (probably bullshit but my anxious brain is in overdrive). uuuuuuugh. Fuck. I need some sleep. Tomorrow will be better."
589,How to overcome the fear that every chest pain is a heart attack ?,Anxiety,"Lately these fucked up thoughts are haunting me and they are so fucking bad, overwhelming and energy consuming ... They had affected my work quality in a bad way since my job requires total focus as software engineer... I just want to conquer the thought that no chest pain, dizziness or other physical feeling is something dangerous ... I've seen a cardiologist and he told me i'm fine but in the midst of the attack i'm not able to focus ... Even therapy and the meds i'm under don't seem to be helping ...
Any helping suggestion kind people ..."
590,My new experience with Anxiety,Anxiety,"Hello,

I want to share a new experience that I've had, and see if anyone else has/is feeling the way I currently am. I am a senior in college pursing a degree which will place me into a high stress, high adrenaline, career path. For the past 20 years of my life, I've percieved myself to embody the passion and ability to be able to be able to work in these conditions, and with the experiences I've gained so far with an internship I've be able to he apart of, I continued to believe this was the case.

However, about three months ago everything changed. I decided to exercise (as quarantine has me sitting around) and found myself unable to bring my breathing, or heart rate, down to a resting level for the remainder of the day. Two ER visits over the next week left me with limited answers. I knew I didn't have covid, any serious emergency illnesses, or anything that was easily detectable.

Unfortunately, as the months have gone on I've noticed that these issues still persist. I am unable to any ""vigorous"" exercise without a sense of panic after the fact (during so is fine, its the afterwards that causes issues), low appetite (I never feel hungry and have lost LBs due to limited eating), along with random heart racing and the inability to feel like I can ""breath all the way"", especially when trying to sleep.

I've tried seeing a therapist, a counselor at my school, multiple doctors, and even some homeopathic remedies but these feelings and thoughts continue to persist. I do feel occasional relief, some days are good, some days are worse, but it always seems as if I have this constant ""entity"" watching over my shoulder ready to take me down at a moments notice.

I'm reaching out to anyone here to see if they've had an experience like me or some of the tips and tricks they've tried. I feel as my options are becoming more limited, like medicine, and due to my career field having a limited supportive view on mental health (especially medication), I want to try everything I can before that. However, I feel like I have, and just want these symptoms to subside and to go back to the person I was before all this happened.

Sorry for the wall of text, I've never posted on reddit before 
TL;DR: I used to be able to run into the fire before, but now I cant even bring myself to stand up."
591,I should have grown up. Now I am 30 years old with no direction in life and no clear decisions.,Anxiety,"All my life I was pampered by my mom and because of that, I have not a care in the world with problems. Basically from what I was when I was a teenager, this is the same mindset I have.

Since I was a kid and up until now, My mom does all the work at home. She does all the laundry, she's the one who cooks food, basically she does everything and it makes me feel guilty and useless. Up until now this is the case and I haven’t improved.

By this time I should have been helping with the laundry, the dishes, the cooking, cleaning the house and everything else housekeeping related. I should have learned how to do “manly” stuff like fixing the sink, changing a car tire, going on adventures, learned to overcome my fear of heights, etc. Instead, I stay at home all day doing nothing but playing games, not talking with people, or hiding when people come to our house.

I am a picky eater and eat mostly unhealthy food. I only eat soft or comfort food which in turn didn’t make me any leaner and more muscular. I have a body of that of a frail little boy. I don’t have strong hands, arms or legs, I can’t run that fast and sweat easily. This is because I don’t exercise and don’t have a healthy lifestyle.

I spent my whole life just playing video games, watching too much anime, movies, Netflix, I had no goals in life, no direction, not thinking about the future. Because of that, It took me very long to finish a single course which took me 8 years. Gaming, Anime and Movies became my life instead.

I am not a people person at all. I hide when visitors come to our house. And because I have made this a habit, I am awkward when trying to approach a person and ask questions. I always get bullied and can become the laughing stock of the group.

I was lucky enough to land a job related to my career which was an electrician and but it involved heights and my fear of heights wasn’t helping, it also required some muscle like carrying big things and doing troubleshooting things and like I said, I have a frail body so basically I was useless.

Since I suck at being an electrician, they placed me over to do admin stuff related paperworks at the same company. Again, I had difficulty because all of there are so many variables to work with and I kept doing wrong things. The manager got so mad at me and I had to get tutored so many times by the staff and they started to hate me.

They put up with me until the end of my contract and were relieved that I was finally gone and replaced with someone with actual skill and someone who had the muscle and the brain.

Then I went freelance. I was able to manage it because they are mostly small businesses, not a lot of variables and was thinking this could be a good career. Then COVID happened and the instability of freelance affected me. I lost a client and then I started to panic and worry that we won’t be having any money left.

Now at this point I began to panic, all of this overthinking, my anxiety and depression was triggered and regrets and worries began to flood my mind.

I am experiencing:

\-heartbreak

\-palpitation of the heart

\-cannot sleep due to heartbreak and the palpitation

\-loss of appetite

\-slight chills

\-loss of passion to do the things I want and love

I keep asking myself what if I finished school earlier? What if I just developed my manhood instead of staying what I was when I was just a kid? Maybe I could have earned a lot more money and did not have to worry about our finances, my parents medication because they are now too old,

And then I just told myself: I should have grown up."
592,Sneak Attack,Anxiety,"I have been fine all morning. I was comfortable and relaxed. I was a little bored but not to the point where I NEEDED to do anything about it. Content is a good word to use I guess. 

My boyfriend expressed he was super bored and suggested we go for a ride and get some food. I got all ready to go. I looked at the sky... white weather.... overcast, bright white color and the air just has an uncomfortable heaviness to it. I gave it a shot but I should have known better. 

We went through the drive thru at a McDonalds. The first thing that sent me into this downward spiral was the interaction between my boyfriend and the drive thru worker over the speaker. It seemed so loud and it hurt my ears ans head. I regrettably made a comment that could have been mistaken for me complaining and being rude so that made my boyfriend feel weird. That wasn't my intent. It just felt like that set the tone for the rest of the ride when i didnt mean it the way it came out. It just legitmatley hurt my ears because it seemed like they were raising their voices. I think maybe I am just super sensitive to loudness. 

So then we left McDonalds. In my head i assumed he was going to park so we could eat before it got cold. We got aways down the road and I asked whete we were going and he said, ""This way."" All of a sudden I just got really uncomfortable and agitated and my brain just went on overdrive. Every logical place to me where we could have parked he proceeded to pass and I didnt want to further damage the mood. I finally spoke up and he parked at a business that was open which made me uncomfortable. And then the next place was a place that was closed but he went out back and to me it just felt sketchy to park there. I finally couldnt take it anymore and told him i wanted to just go home. On the way home i had to shut my eyes and just focus on my breathing so i wouldnt have a full fledged panic attack. I was so uncomfortable with not knowing the plan or where we were going and was getting aggravated that the food was getting cold. 

I am so tired of my anxiety ruining everything for me. I cant even go on a normal drive with my boyfriend without this happening. 

I knew the air felt heavy and that the white weather was going to make me feel like crap. 

Ugh, I wish I could have a do over  for today :("
593,"Just want to write down my experience (insomnia, panic attacks, general anxiety)",Anxiety,"So I am as usual of a 17y/o guy as it can get. I did not have any traumatic experiences and generally have a pretty easy life. I had a few panic attacks in middle school, but nothing mayor. It all picked up about one and a half years ago when changing schools. I had several panic attacks in class, not beeing able to breath, just almost fully passed out a few times. Then I had a few sleepless nights here and there. That picked up recently. I can't remember the last time I went a week without a sleepless night. I have trouble accepting my feelings and they don't feel valid because I don't have anything to worry about or people always tell me stuff like:""just sleep bro it's not that hard"" They obviously never were in that situation. I now met this amazing girl. We don't have feelings for each other and decided on a friend's with benefits relationship and she was the first person to make my feelings feel valid. She was there for me when I could not sleep and just let me cry my heart out. But now I am conflicted on what to do because those meetups give me anxiety even though I feel very comfortable around her. We were supposed to meet today but I could not sleep the night before and had to cancel. She tries to support me in any way possible but I just don't know if I can keep this up. Then again I can't run from my feelings. Exposure therapy I guess. I would rather have  severe anxiety and a panic attack in the morning with her around then alone. But I also don't want to get to attached to her. What do I do? This is killing me. Sorry for the vent. It helped me get it out there I can hopefully sleep better now."
594,"Blushing, neck pains, blood pressure!",Anxiety,"Does anyone have daily episodes of chest pounding, blusing o face , high bp, neck pains?

Is this dangerous?"
595,Can’t stop touching wood?,Anxiety,"About a year ago I started knocking on wood (as a way to ward off bad luck) and I’ve become obsessed with it since then. Usually many many times a day but particularly at night time or when I’m using my phone (I use my phone the most at night before bed). Anytime I think of or see anything even remotely negative I have to knock on wood as to not feel distress. 
Scrolling down Twitter or listening to the news are particularly triggering but it’s also often just random negative thoughts popping on my mind. 

Sometimes I’m in bed about to fall asleep and suddenly I’ll think of something negative and I’ll need to stand up and go find wood to touch. Or I’ll be comfortably lying in the sofa, hear something in the TV and then I’ll have to move so I can reach the table and touch the wood. 

I’ve noticed the frequency of these cycles of negative thoughts and urges are getting more and more frequent and I’m worried and very frustrated that I can’t stop myself. 

Logically, I know that touching wood is not going to protect me or my loved ones from bad things but I’m not able to internalise this. 

Is this something that resonates with others? Is this some form of anxiety or OCD? 

Any suggesting on ways to manage this would be really appreciated!

Edit: Replacing touching wood with “knocking on wood” and clarifying its meaning as some people thought it was something sexual."
596,"I want to cry, but I cant",Anxiety,I am struggling with anxiety.sometimes I want to cry loud but I can't.i wish I were able to cry loud.darkness inside me needs tears .
597,My anxiety is out of control since I started my new meds,Anxiety,"I know that this can happen and it takes a while to get better but it just sucks so much. Like I just sit there cry all the time. Stuff is actually looking a bit better recently. I've met someone who is really cool but my anxiety makes it impossible to take a step forward, because I'm scared that it will be the like last time where I liked someone and they just stop talking to me and found someone better. 
I just want stuff to work out once in my life"
598,extreme anxiety after getting a bad tattoo,Anxiety,"hello
two weeks ago i gave myself a stick and poke and it went wrong as hell. i have had anxiety problems for a few years already, and it has been getting more and more intense, but now it feels so extreme i can barely function sometimes. i could not stop shaking for the first couple of days and i still wake up at night in panic and anger my stupid self. i have told my conservative mom about what i have done and she of course was not pleased, it did not change our relationship as drastically as i have expected, so that is cool. the anxiety is actually getting better slowly and i have finally stopped having heartaches, full on panic attacks and i am finally able to eat and digest some food, but i still can't sleep sometimes and my skin feels like it's burning from the inside and i cannot concentrate during online lessons and reading about tattoo removal. i have poked way too deep and the tattoo has scarred a little and because of this and also because of thick black lines and poor blood circulation in my feet i am not optimistic about laser removal. i am considering getting it removed surgically since i have nothing against scars, but i dread the operation so much. the fact that i am in a lockdown and that i get intensely obsessed with things so easily makes it even worse. how can i stop obsessing over it? how to calm down and forgive myself? how to finally learn to concentrate and study again? 
(p.s. the tattoo is about 15 square cm big)"
599,I don't wanna grow up 😭😭😭😭,Anxiety,"Turned 14 yesterday. It's gonna be 4 years until i'm 18. I don't wanna grow up, i'm enjoying myself as a young teenager, anxiety aside. I'm gonna have to get a job and have so many responsibillities and I don't even CARE about getting a boyfriend yet. The thing is im obsessed with wanting to do everything I possibly can and not regret anything. I'm scared, I don't feel ready for anything. 😭😭

Is this what they call an existiential crisis"
600,How do I manage this?,Anxiety,"So back in June I had a massive anxiety attack, first time it had ever happened like Iron Man 3 severe. Got diagnosed with Anxiety a couple month later Bradycardia(slow heart beat) because I kept having weird jolts of small pain and in my head I'd have them too thought it was a stroke or worse Aneurysm.

Now I'm on Prozac which helps but I have the brief period of panic where my heart doesn't feel right or it does something I'm not use to feeling. The doctor said after a echocardiogram and wearing a Holter moniter that my heart is totally healthy. 

How do I stop such paranoia from stressing my anxiety out and letting myself think ""well this is it""? Its exhausting and I hate not being able to remind myself that I'm fine. I'm 28 for christ sake and I'm just hoping someone can guide me with this cause I hate being so miserable"
601,Can’t afford health care,Anxiety,I stopped taking Zoloft because 1) I couldn’t afford a doctors visit for a refill and 2) I really thought I had my mind under control and thought I wouldn’t need them anymore. Turns out I was wrong about that and the depression and anxiety is creeping back in. I want to get back on antidepressants but I have $2 in my bank account and to see a doctor in my town it’s upward of $150. Idk what to do or what any advice you could offer given differences in states etc.. but any advice is appreciated
602,Discord Server?,Anxiety,Is there a discord server for ppl with anxiety? are any of you guys are a part of any such server?
603,Beta-Blockers for Anxiety?,Anxiety,"So I did a check up at the doctor, because I was worried about my heart. We did a EKG and blood pressure. The only thing is that cane back ‘abnormal’ is that my heart rate was quite high. But was also very nervous during the appointment lol so I feel like it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. 

I also let him know that I struggle with anxiety and that I was anxious right now, so that might account for the high heart rate. 

He then told me some relaxation techniques to calm my pulse whenever I get anxious. And he prescribed me Beta-Blockers....which I found odd since I though they were quite a heavy drug. 
To be fair, he did say that I should only take these in emergencies, so when I have a panic attack or before an exam or public speech etc. 

Has anyone had experience with this drug? I don’t know if I’m comfortable taking a drug like that, when I’ve managed to survive most of my panic attacks on my own. Idk...

any thoughts?"
604,Avoiding the Dentist due to Anxiety? Here is a Bunch of Helpful Tips!,Anxiety," 

TW: minor mentions of blood and medical procedures

This post is long, and in two parts:

1. Dentist Prep
   1. A series of tips to make you feel more confident in your teeth before going to the dentist
2. My Standard Experience
   1. A step by step guide to a standard dentist appointment from my experience. I went to the dentist every 6 months until 18 and had braces (meaning an appointment every two weeks or so) for 2 years.

Dentist Prep:

1. Two Weeks Until Appointment
   1. Brush your teeth at least once a day
      1. My favorite time to brush my teeth is during my nightly shower. I will put my conditioner in, then brush my teeth before rinsing my hair. I know it is a little weird, but it fits well there during my routine.
      2. Another way I excite myself to brush my teeth is by indulging in my toothbrush and toothpaste. I have a kid’s toothbrush that is purple and blue with a suction cup on the bottom. Why? Because it makes me smile when I stick it to the shower wall. I also don’t like mint toothpaste. So I buy orange or cinnamon or berry. Who cares what flavor your toothpaste is, you know?
   2. Use mouthwash after every meal when possible
      1. Put mouthwash in every bathroom of the house and keep it visible. Every time you wash your hands you can use mouthwash. Having it accessible meant I was far more likely to use it.
      2. Along that vein, I like to keep one of those little TSA shampoo bottles filled with mouthwash in my purse or my car just so I can always freshen up after eating.
      3. I also like to buy ACT Mouthwash. Not only did my dentist recommend it for the fluoride, but their bottles have a fun self measuring mechanism that makes me happy.
   3. Stay hydrated
      1. A lot of people would say that you need to drink only water during this time and yes, in an ideal world, that would be great. This isn’t an ideal world and you are welcome to drink whatever you like - but just drink plenty!
2. One Week Until Appointment
   1. Continue all previous habits
   2. Floss every other day
      1. The first few times you floss, it is going to suck. Your gums will bleed and swell. Your lips will be sore. But once you learn how to maneuver the floss and your gums adjust, it will get A LOT easier.
      2. I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and I find those floss/pick/pipe cleaner things are super helpful in cleaning around the hardware 
3. Two Days Until Appointment
   1. Brush teeth for a solid 10 minutes
      1. This is another time that makes me really like brushing my teeth in the shower. If you aren’t about that, then plop on the toilet seat with a book and go to town. Find every nook and cranny - including your tongue. I usually re-toothpaste once or twice and will rinse whenever I need to.
   2. Floss for the last time before your appointment
4. Day of Appointment
   1. Brush your teeth in the morning
   2. Mouthwash and toothpick before appointment
      1. I like to do this to make sure I don’t have any of my lunch in my teeth or anything crazy. This isn’t the time to re-brush your teeth because the hygenist is going to do that anyway.

My Standard Experience

1. Arrive and Check In
   1. Usually there is a small lobby and a reception desk. First you will go to the reception desk and tell them you are here to check in. They will usually ask a few questions. If there is any paperwork you need to fill out, they will give it to you then.
   2. Next you wait. Now is the time to fill out any paperwork the reception gives you and return it when finished. Most people will just sit in the lobby and use their phones until their name is called. The reception will know the wifi password and are usually happy to give it out.
2. Walk Through to the Back
   1. A Dental Hygienist will, at some point, walk out and call your name. Go with them as they lead you to your appointment. The rooms are usually private so no one can see you during your appointment.
   2. If you brought your coat/bag to the back with you, there is normally an extra chair for you to set them on.
3. Sitting in the Chair
   1. Getting onto a dental chair seems like a tricky thiing, but it can be pretty simple.
   2. Sit down, butt first in the middle (usually the lowest point)
   3. Swing your legs over (either at the same time or one at a time) there are usually arm rests that are helpful to keep you balanced
   4. Lean back onto the slanted part.
4. Prep
   1. The hygienist will usually put a bib on you. This is to protect your clothes, but also as a tool wipe during the cleaning. Don’t worry, nothing they wipe on the bib will end up on you.
   2. While you sit in the chair, they are going to be pulling up your information and they might ask some questions (are you having any pain? How often do you floss? etc). Answer them honestly, they are not going to judge you. 
5. The Basics
   1. The hygienist will lean your chair back, possibly give you sunglasses, and pull a large light over your head.
   2. Now is when you are gonna open your mouth. Keep your jaw in a comfortable position and relax your face. I liken it to being halfway through a yawn, when your whole face goes lax. Try not to flex your lips or they will get sore quickly. If you need some, they always have extra chapstick!
   3. If you need to sneeze, cough, swallow, gag, etc. just put your hand up to catch their attention. If they don’t see you, tap them on the arm or shoulder. They are always happy to give you a break if you need one.
   4. Often they will give you small amounts of water. Treat it like mouthwash and swish it through your mouth for a couple seconds. Then you can either spit it into a sink or they have a suction straw that will pull out the water. You don’t need to swallow it.
   5. The suction straw is not powerful enough to hurt you. It can be a bit loud, but it is designed not to hurt you if you stick your tongue on it.
   6. Try to keep your tongue relaxed but out of the way of where they are working. Don’t freak out if you lick their hand on accident - it happens all the time! Why do you think their gloves are flavored? Lol
   7. Some places will have TVs mounted to the ceiling for you to watch. Some have Where’s Waldo posters, some have nothing. It is a bit of a grab bag. The hygienist will not notice what you are looking at. You can look at them, what they are doing, the ceiling, you can close your eyes, etc. I have actually fallen asleep during an appointment before and they don’t mind. If you would like, you can also put on headphones.
6. Cleaning
   1. First, the hygienist will go in with the metal scraping tools. This is to manually remove plaque that builds ups on our teeth. If you brush your teeth or you don’t, this is going to happen regardless! Plaque isn’t removed with a standard toothbrush in most cases.
   2. Next is flossing. The hygienists are incredibly thorough with this and it takes some time.
   3. The hygienist might give you options of what flavor toothpaste you want for the cleaning. Then they will go in to basically polish each tooth with an electric toothbrush. Periodically, they will have you swish and rinse water to clear out the toothpaste.
7. The Dentist
   1. Once the cleaning is done, the hygienist will call for the dentist. When they come in, they are essentially going to inspect your teeth. If you have any problems (mouth pain, tooth pain, wiggly teeth, etc.) let the dentist know and they will try to determine the cause.
8. Check Out
   1. Once this is done, the hygienist will put your chair upright, take off the bib, etc. and you are set to leave. Make sure to stop by the reception on the way out to make sure there is nothing else they need. Sometimes they need to confirm an address or ask if you want to schedule another appointment.

I hope that this can help you be more comfortable with going to a dentist appointment in the future! If anything I have suggested or written seems problematic, incorrect, harmful, or otherwise, please let me know! I’m happy to learn as well!"
605,I need help,Anxiety,"I’ve had anxiety my entire life. Literally since I was a kid. I have no idea where it comes from, it just exists. I’ve tried SSRIs for 10 years and while they helped, I developed issues with weight gain and libido. So that’s off the table. Therapy doesn’t help either because I’m already aware of my thoughts and feelings of anxiety. I’m trying to exercise and a better diet. Idk what to do besides that. Friends make me nervous because I feel like I’m always judged."
606,"Nearly all my anxiety dreams are related to school, is that normal??",Anxiety,I would say a good 80% of them relate back to school or being a teenager somehow. I still have terrible anxiety but at least I don’t have to hang round teenagers anymore they are the worst.
607,I drowned in anxiety and panic. I want to help you with my story.,Anxiety,"Today I am thankful for feeling positive in my mental health! 

    On August 13th we faced a tragic and shocking loss in our family and I wasn't sure I could ever feel happiness again. My aunt was found dead in a homeless encampment and I had to wonder if she was murdered, or raped, or both.how could her gentle soul and body be there without loved ones surrounding her? I had panic attacks every day and felt constant fear that something would happen to my other loved ones and I would not be able to take the pain. That if one more person I loved was to die I wouldn’t be able to live anymore. If one of my children died, I thought maybe I would kill myself- something I never admitted to my family. For so long the darkness of worry consumed me. I cried all day. I sobbed. I felt the world was spinning out of control. She was like a mother to me, and as I got older- a child to me. She was an alcoholic and struggled for decades. After 3 solid months of daily anxiety and darkness, I was able to feel peace and some sense of closure. The coroner’s report finally came back after being delayed by Covid autopsies. We found out that she died on her own accord, and somehow it made me feel better. She died of an overdose. I learned that whenever she left rehab she would do meth because it was cheap. I was shocked but somehow not surprised. She didn’t want to feel. Something in her life pushed her into numbness. I may never know what that force was. It may not make sense, but it did to me. In some f*cked up way I was grateful that she didn’t know what was coming. I'm sharing these intimate details because if anyone of you are struggling in your lives, reach to your family for support. Reach out to therapists, and focus on self care. It's okay to give yourself a break. Who cares if you need time to do nothing and just ""be"". If you need to hide in your bed and sob and scream, do it. If you need to go on an hours long run just to be alone and to escape reality, do it. If you want to punch the shit out of something, get some boxing gloves. There is no timeline for grief. The ""stages"" are jumbled and non- linear. My hope is that this reaches someone who may need to hear this, and it tells you that no matter how painful a loss is to you, you will be able to feel like yourself again in time.  

I feel strange sharing these vulnerable thoughts, but I want to give you hope. Don’t fight your grief. Learn to work with it."
608,My girlfriend won't let me use benadryl to sleep,Anxiety,"I have severe anxiety and throughout our relationship she has helped me not use substances to get through my problem. As harsh as she may be, she's a nurse. She said she'd break up with me if I smoked again and she also said she'd break up with me of I drank to get rid of my problems... so now I'm helpless, idk how to get through anything anymore and I cant sleep, its been a week and I've slept a collective of 12 hours. I cant take anything to help me sleep or she'll break up with me. So, if anyone has some suggestions that will help me sleep or help me just get through the day, please lmk."
609,I got an anxiety attack over something stupid,Anxiety,"I dont know why my mind does this. It feels paralyzing, like someone is holding a gun to my head. I cant move. I know its a stupid reason yet the fear is a physical thing. My heart races. I feel ashamed on top of that. Im tired."
610,It made me sick,Anxiety,"I was in hospital after a major panic attack that made me sick. Couldn't stop being sick so I ended up being in hospital.

I want to go back to see my old psychiatrist but that would mean discussing it with my mother. Feeling pretty hopeless"
611,Anxiety and inability to speak,Anxiety,"Does any else get so anxious about something that they can’t speak?  Because that’s what happened at work today.  I could barely talk to my coworkers, let alone tell people goodbye and have a nice day."
612,Nice Guy Syndrome,Anxiety,"You feel like you have to be nice all the time, 

You're  worried feeling insecure without a reason.

you can't even express how you feel that makes you hate yourself because your self esteem is low.

people doesn't notice you because your hiding from tension.

There's a voice inside your head keep torturing you, no matter how you try to escape it, it doesn't go away.

Women friend zone you no matter how you love them. 

Guess what a nice guy personality is a Shame/ trauma based personality."
613,I wanna go to this party in my dorms but I don't think they want me there.,Anxiety,"After all, when I wrote that ""maybe I'll go for once"" in the group chat, nobody really reacted. I said I go to bed early, this guy said he couldn't come in time due to work- and it was proposed that the party be delayed until after my bed time (which was declined, but still). I've always been quiet and kinda distant during these parties due to anxiety, which could be taken as rude. 

It's probably better if I don't go. They don't want me there, it's probably livelier without me. Going there is scary"
614,Continuous state and anxiety. Losing my mind,Anxiety,"Since last Saturday I'm living in a continuous state of anxiety. Frequent panic attacks. Just took half of Alprazolam (Xanax) to not feel this anymore. I have a hard time to enjoy things at the moment. Can't enjoy a nice meal, don't smile/laugh anymore, for crying out loud I'm on the sofa with my girlfriend and I can't seem to relax. In less than and hour the meds should kick in. Let's hope I find some relief.

I already made an appointment with a therapist. But she's very busy so my first session will be in about 2 weeks. 

Made this post to vent. Tips are always welcome!

This was my Ted Talk, thank you for listening. (Always end with a joke right?)"
615,Can’t stop overthinking past conversations/situations,Anxiety,"I can’t stop thinking about a conversation I had yesterday. Even though it was nothing bad, I now can’t fight the feeling that I really just embarrassed myself. It also doesn’t help that certain people’s opinions of me matter more to me, and one of those people was involved. How do you stop worrying about conversations or things that have already happened? I don’t even have to see these people again until Monday, but I’m already feeling like I embarrassed myself and don’t want to see them again."
616,How do I explain to my parents that living with them makes me an anxious mess?,Anxiety,"I’ve been in college for about four years living in my own apartment with my friends my anxiety started almost about two years ago I noticed that when I came home my anxiety would skyrocket. It’s a very hectic household with a bunch of people screaming and yelling and a dog barking overall it’s just chaotic. Every time I try to bring this up they get offended but they seriously don’t understand how much it affects me. Next semester I decided to move back home to save money, but I’m dreading it. My grandma offered to let me stay at her house because she understands how chaotic it is there. when I brought it up to my parents they were extremely offended and made me feel bad about it. I’m 22 so they technically can’t control me but they do pay for my college so I’m put in a really awkward position I want to stand up for myself but I’m not financially independent and it sucks. I want them to see that I need to be living in a calm environment in order for me to work on my anxiety and mental health in general they just won’t see it the way that I see it does anyone have any advice on what I should do?"
617,How does one get over the fear of driving?,Anxiety,"A little backstory: When I was 18 I did my practice for my driving licence. Before I start my father told me that he doesn't see me driving, that I don't have what it takes, that I am too soft etc..needless to say that he was also pissed of because I didn't choose the instructor he wanted. I think he basically conditioned me to think that but I also think he was right. When I had to take the psychologycal test, i failed my first attempt and I had to take it twice, the written and computer based part as well - i was really tired and didn't take it very seriously because everyone was telling me that everyone passes the psychologycal test, so I just couldn't focus and didn't make an effort to try. When the time came to take my practical test on the road I remember my father pulled some strings and i passed my practical test even if i shouldn't have.
Now, I really believe I not made to drive even if I would like to....I am afraid I will not be able control the car...
What do you think? Would be nice to hear some expert advice"
618,Anxiety app,Anxiety,"I’m an iOS developer and am about to start an open source project to help people who suffer from anxiety, myself included. 

I would like to ask if anyone has any ideas for features or functionality you believe would be beneficial.

Throw anything at me."
619,lightheadedness,Anxiety,"hello. for the past few weeks, i've been feeling really lightheaded when i stand up. it's not like a brief rush right after i get on my feet- it's more of a constant dull feeling that comes and goes every couple seconds. it gets more frequent the longer i stand up and it's scaring me. i don't know if it's anxiety causing it or what but as someone with really bad health anxiety i'm very worried about it. it eventually goes away after resting for 10-ish minutes but comes right back when i get on my feet. can anyone help? is this anxiety related?"
620,My girlfriend,Anxiety,"Me and my girlfriend are currently in a long distance relationship and my anxiety and overthinking of her with others guys are absolutely through the roof, I know she’s not like that and we’re really reassuring to each other and communicative but I still find myself crying over this, can someone give me some help"
621,My life with anxiety.. (I hope),Anxiety,"I have been reading through a few of the posts of anxiety and I thought I would share some of my fun and games I go through on a daily basis. I had my first Anxiety/Panic attack in 2012, my brother passed away in a car crash and couple months later while I was on the way to work I witnessed a fatal car crash in front of me and since that day I have suffered from anxiety. Let me break down my different conditions for you all. Let me know if you can relate.

I think I have had every cancer known to man, if I get the slightest of pain in my stomach I think I have bowl cancer or iv just ruptured a ulcer and I’m on the verge of bleeding out. 

I hold all my stress in my shoulders which radiates to my neck which caused tension headaches and I instantly think I have brain cancer or I’m having an brain aneurism. 

And most famously I have been having heart attacks for the past 8 years.. this is by far the worst, I will get a pain in my chest and I will press it, I press it all day until I bruise and then press it more. I can not shake the fear of having a heart attack, I will spring out of bed as I’m falling asleep because I think one is starting. I just don’t know what to do about it. I am too afraid to exercise because i think it will cause a heart attack. I am too afraid to visit the doctor. I did many years ago and he said I had anxiety and I was put on medication which I took myself off because it was not doing much for me. Today I had a little chest pain and I have pushed it so hard all day that I have welted and bruised the area I just can’t stop. 

I live in constant fear of dying and it sucks. I also have a strange habit of hearing about an illness that someone got and then I will state mimicking the symptoms. I think I am a full blown hypochondriac. My wife is sick of it I am sick of it! I just wish I could fix this situation.. 

Let me know what you guys go through and fight with and how you deal with it."
622,How do you cope?,Anxiety,"I’ve had GAD since I was 12, but quarantine is making the physical symptoms way worse. Is there any recommendations on what I can do to calm it all down? Even if it’s just a meditation app or a stress ball, I’m open to all ideas."
623,PVCs,Anxiety,Does anyone else here get a ton of PVCs during a panic attack like every beat your heart skips or skips after a few beats? It’s very scary and un comfortable and I’ve said this to my doctor so many times and I won’t even go on a walk because my heart does the exact same thing because I get so nervous it will happen. My doctor says my heart is fine after having an Ecg and bloods but I cannot cope anymore. He did refer me to get a holter monitor done but that might take a few months. I’m at Whitt’s end here I’ve been dealing with this on and off for 5 years and I don’t feel normal I feel like I’m going to die everyday it is not normal. Can someone help me :(
624,Who else gets hit with an anxiety attack for no reason whatsoever?,Anxiety,"I feel like typically people have something that triggers an anxiety/panic attack, and I certainly have them, but right now I got hit with it out of nowhere. I recently was diagnosed with GAD as well as bipolar disorder and currently going through a shitty depression episode and I’ve learned that anxiety distress is common with bipolar patients and man does it fucking suck. It sucks because I don’t even know where it’s originated from or why it’s there. I’m panicking and feel like something awful is going to happen and just anxious for no reason. Shit sucks."
625,How to not take everything seriously,Anxiety,"I take every single thing seriously. If a random friend of mine texts me hi, I get anxious thinking what they are going to talk about. I stress over really silly things and it has affected my health. I really want to lead a calmer and carefree life. Any advice?"
626,Coming to Accept That My Parents Played a Massive Part in Why I Suffer with Anxiety,Anxiety,"This is to vent more than anything. I need to get it off my chest.

The red flags were there from a very young age when my friends told me they thought my dad was scary, but I just laughed it off and would say ""you're only dealing with him for an evening! I have to live with him!"" 

My parents were pretty strict with my upbringing. They're not religious, but they always seem to care how the family is perceived by strangers, and I and my younger brother had to be the outstanding model child of the school/town (which wasn't going to happen) and anything that could be deemed as embarrassing, they got very angry at. 

My dad also has had depression as long as I can remember and it has always been like walking on eggshells around him and, when I was kid/teen, my mum as well because she carried a lot of the everyday stresses and his woes as well.

I got bullied throughout primary and secondary school, and my parents reaction to it was always ""just ignore them"" other than one time in year6 my dad told me to say to a boy who was teasing me for the football team I like ""at least I go see my team"" and I was sent out of the class for saying it. I really hated school but I felt like I couldn't say anything to my parents because they got angry so quickly. 

They get scary angry at anything. We went to Canada when I was 7 and turned 8 while we were there and I remember sitting and crying in the corner of the apartment we were staying at because I felt so alone and separate from my parents I thought I must be adopted. They asked what's wrong and I told them this and they got angry and it made me feel 100x worse. 

When I was 10 we went to Majorca and I was terrified of deep water, and my dad carried me out into the sea to try show me it's ok, but I saw a plastic bag (which at the time I thought was a jellyfish) and I freaked out and screamed and kicked and swam back to the beach. My godparents who we had gone with were laughing but my parents were so angry in that moment I felt I had ruined the entire holiday. 

I'm not sure how old I was but it was younger than 11 I was constantly told I washed my face too quick in the mornings getting ready for school, but then I took too long washing my face, and apparently I just couldn't get it right in their eyes. So one day they told me when a friend came round to ask if I could come out to play I had to tell him no because I can't wash my face properly, which I did and then ran to my room in tears because I was so embarrassed. 

I grew up through secondary and college not wanting to invite people over because I knew how bad my parents could be even in front of friends. They'd call me into the next room over and have a go at me, saying I was showing them up, or showing off for my friends, when all I was doing was allowed myself to be myself around my friends.

I ended up hiding my true emotions at home and resented living at home, I was so envious of friends who had moved out to go to university or move away as I felt so trapped. I couldn't even do my hobbies. I couldn't sing in the house because my dad worked from home. I couldn't even have an electronic keyboard with headphones in because the keys clanking was too annoying. I bought a Ukulele which I sold within a week because I was too scared to play it with my dad around. I became a shell that sometimes exploded with anger because I got so frustrated. My parents would ""tease"" and ""wind me up"" but it was genuinely upsetting or frustrating most of the time and when I snapped back at it they told me I had anger management issues. I was a horrible person. 

My parents said to me on several occasions ""We love you, but sometimes we don't like you.""

At 18 I decided I'd set my own pet care business up (I did animal care at college and animals are my life) during the set up and the 4 years I ran it. My parents may have thought they were giving advice, but all it came across as was criticism. When I was first trying to figure out how to set it up my dad was so critical, I was too scared to ask for help. 

To this day, even though my dad will say he will help with website stuff if I ever need it, I am terrified to ask him for help because of his reaction. 

At 21 I could afford to buy and stable my own horse! This was my dream come true!! I was so happy, so thrilled! I was over the moon! I arranged it all myself I bought a thoroughbred mare who was absolutely beautiful (turned out to be a nutcase to ride but she was a beauty on the ground) and I came home one day with a saddle I had bought for her to ask my dad if he'd come up to the yard and take some photos of me with my new horse. My parents reaction haunts me even now. They destroyed my joy in a look. ""What have you done?"" They pretty much disowned me for a few days. I was heartbroken. This was the one thing I had wanted since I started riding at 4 years old and I had achieved it! And my dad said to me ""I bet you it won't last a year."" 

A final example will be my parents sat me and my brother down last May to tell us why they and our grandmother had fallen out about 5 years ago and they don't talk (this came up as I'm getting married and we were wondering about if they're going to be civil). My dad told us he had a bad childhood because his mom (said grandmother) left him and his brother with his dad and their step mum who was by the sounds of it like the wicked evil step mother. Now this certainly did clear up why they wouldn't talk to her anymore. The woman was a vile manipulative witch who had even manipulated me and my brother our entire lives (which is another reason I'm f***ed) but it also sounded like they were trying to give an excuse to their way of raising us. 

Now I have done phone call therapy, group therapy, one to one talking therapy, CBT, and now trying medication for a second time. But I have always blamed myself for how I feel. I have never wanted to place the blame on anyone else. But now I am looking back at everything that has happened to me and I can pinpoint the way I am now has a heck of a lot to do with my parents and the fear they instilled in me.

I feel like I am a scared little mouse that fears doing any wrong, fears bumping into certain people in the streets or a shop, fears ruining my partner's life, just fears everything.

And I don't know what to do."
